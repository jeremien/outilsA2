a robot is a machine—especially one programmable by a computer— capable of carrying out a complex series of actions automatically  robots can be guided by an external control device or the control may be embedded within  robots may be constructed to take on human form but most robots are machines designed to perform a task with no regard to how they look  robots can be autonomous or semi autonomous and range from humanoids such as honda s advanced step in innovative mobility  asimo  and tosy s tosy ping pong playing robot  topio  to industrial robots  medical operating robots  patient assist robots  dog therapy robots  collectively programmed swarm robots  uav drones such as general atomics mq 1 predator  and even microscopic nano robots  by mimicking a lifelike appearance or automating movements  a robot may convey a sense of intelligence or thought of its own  autonomous things are expected to proliferate in the coming decade  with home robotics and the autonomous car as some of the main drivers  the branch of technology that deals with the design  construction  operation  and application of robots  as well as computer systems for their control  sensory feedback  and information processing is robotics  these technologies deal with automated machines that can take the place of humans in dangerous environments or manufacturing processes  or resemble humans in appearance  behavior  or cognition  many of today s robots are inspired by nature contributing to the field of bio inspired robotics  these robots have also created a newer branch of robotics  soft robotics  from the time of ancient civilization there have been many accounts of user configurable automated devices and even automata resembling animals and humans  designed primarily as entertainment  as mechanical techniques developed through the industrial age  there appeared more practical applications such as automated machines  remote control and wireless remote control  the term comes from a czech word  robota  meaning  forced labor   the word  robot  was first used to denote a fictional humanoid in a 1920 play r u r  by the czech writer  karel čapek but it was karel s brother josef čapek who was the word s true inventor  electronics evolved into the driving force of development with the advent of the first electronic autonomous robots created by william grey walter in bristol  england in 1948  as well as computer numerical control  cnc  machine tools in the late 1940s by john t  parsons and frank l  stulen  the first commercial  digital and programmable robot was built by george devol in 1954 and was named the unimate  it was sold to general motors in 1961 where it was used to lift pieces of hot metal from die casting machines at the inland fisher guide plant in the west trenton section of ewing township  new jersey  robots have replaced humans in performing repetitive and dangerous tasks which humans prefer not to do  or are unable to do because of size limitations  or which take place in extreme environments such as outer space or the bottom of the sea  there are concerns about the increasing use of robots and their role in society  robots are blamed for rising technological unemployment as they replace workers in increasing numbers of functions  the use of robots in military combat raises ethical concerns  the possibilities of robot autonomy and potential repercussions have been addressed in fiction and may be a realistic concern in the future 

the word robot can refer to both physical robots and virtual software agents  but the latter are usually referred to as bots  there is no consensus on which machines qualify as robots but there is general agreement among experts  and the public  that robots tend to possess some or all of the following abilities and functions  accept electronic programming  process data or physical perceptions electronically  operate autonomously to some degree  move around  operate physical parts of itself or physical processes  sense and manipulate their environment  and exhibit intelligent behavior  especially behavior which mimics humans or other animals  closely related to the concept of a robot is the field of synthetic biology  which studies entities whose nature is more comparable to beings than to machines 

the idea of automata originates in the mythologies of many cultures around the world  engineers and inventors from ancient civilizations  including ancient china  ancient greece  and ptolemaic egypt  attempted to build self operating machines  some resembling animals and humans  early descriptions of automata include the artificial doves of archytas  the artificial birds of mozi and lu ban  a  speaking  automaton by hero of alexandria  a washstand automaton by philo of byzantium  and a human automaton described in the lie zi 

many ancient mythologies  and most modern religions include artificial people  such as the mechanical servants built by the greek god hephaestus  vulcan to the romans   the clay golems of jewish legend and clay giants of norse legend  and galatea  the mythical statue of pygmalion that came to life  since circa 400 bc  myths of crete include talos  a man of bronze who guarded the cretan island of europa from pirates  in ancient greece  the greek engineer ctesibius  c  270 bc   applied a knowledge of pneumatics and hydraulics to produce the first organ and water clocks with moving figures   in the 4th century bc  the greek mathematician archytas of tarentum postulated a mechanical steam operated bird he called  the pigeon   hero of alexandria  10–70 ad   a greek mathematician and inventor  created numerous user configurable automated devices  and described machines powered by air pressure  steam and water  the 11th century lokapannatti tells of how the buddha s relics were protected by mechanical robots  bhuta vahana yanta   from the kingdom of roma visaya  rome   until they were disarmed by king ashoka  in ancient china  the 3rd century text of the lie zi describes an account of humanoid automata  involving a much earlier encounter between chinese emperor king mu of zhou and a mechanical engineer known as yan shi  an  artificer   yan shi proudly presented the king with a life size  human shaped figure of his mechanical  handiwork  made of leather  wood  and artificial organs  there are also accounts of flying automata in the han fei zi and other texts  which attributes the 5th century bc mohist philosopher mozi and his contemporary lu ban with the invention of artificial wooden birds  ma yuan  that could successfully fly  in 1066  the chinese inventor su song built a water clock in the form of a tower which featured mechanical figurines which chimed the hours  the beginning of automata is associated with the invention of early su song s astronomical clock tower featured mechanical figurines that chimed the hours  his mechanism had a programmable drum machine with pegs  cams  that bumped into little levers that operated percussion instruments  the drummer could be made to play different rhythms and different drum patterns by moving the pegs to different locations  samarangana sutradhara  a sanskrit treatise by bhoja  11th century   includes a chapter about the construction of mechanical contrivances  automata   including mechanical bees and birds  fountains shaped like humans and animals  and male and female dolls that refilled oil lamps  danced  played instruments  and re enacted scenes from hindu mythology  in renaissance italy  leonardo da vinci  1452–1519  sketched plans for a humanoid robot around 1495  da vinci s notebooks  rediscovered in the 1950s  contained detailed drawings of a mechanical knight now known as leonardo s robot  able to sit up  wave its arms and move its head and jaw  the design was probably based on anatomical research recorded in his vitruvian man  it is not known whether he attempted to build it in japan  complex animal and human automata were built between the 17th to 19th centuries  with many described in the 18th century karakuri zui  illustrated machinery  1796   one such automaton was the karakuri ningyō  a mechanized puppet  different variations of the karakuri existed  the butai karakuri  which were used in theatre  the zashiki karakuri  which were small and used in homes  and the dashi karakuri which were used in religious festivals  where the puppets were used to perform reenactments of traditional myths and legends  in france  between 1738 and 1739  jacques de vaucanson exhibited several life sized automatons  a flute player  a pipe player and a duck  the mechanical duck could flap its wings  crane its neck  and swallow food from the exhibitor s hand  and it gave the illusion of digesting its food by excreting matter stored in a hidden compartment 

remotely operated vehicles were demonstrated in the late 19th century in the form of several types of remotely controlled torpedoes  the early 1870s saw remotely controlled torpedoes by john ericsson  pneumatic   john louis lay  electric wire guided   and victor von scheliha  electric wire guided   the brennan torpedo  invented by louis brennan in 1877 was powered by two contra rotating propellors that were spun by rapidly pulling out wires from drums wound inside the torpedo  differential speed on the wires connected to the shore station allowed the torpedo to be guided to its target  making it  the world s first practical guided missile   in 1897 the british inventor ernest wilson was granted a patent for a torpedo remotely controlled by  hertzian   radio  waves and in 1898 nikola tesla publicly demonstrated a wireless controlled torpedo that he hoped to sell to the us navy  archibald low  known as the  father of radio guidance systems  for his pioneering work on guided rockets and planes during the first world war  in 1917  he demonstrated a remote controlled aircraft to the royal flying corps and in the same year built the first wire guided rocket 

 robot  was first applied as a term for artificial automata in a 1920 play r u r  by the czech writer  karel čapek  however  josef čapek was named by his brother karel as the true inventor of the term robot  the word  robot  itself was not new  having been in slavic language as robota  forced laborer   a term which classified those peasants obligated to compulsory service under the feudal system widespread in 19th century europe  see  robot patent   čapek s fictional story postulated the technological creation of artificial human bodies without souls  and the old theme of the feudal robota class eloquently fit the imagination of a new class of manufactured  artificial workers 

in 1928  one of the first humanoid robots  eric  was exhibited at the annual exhibition of the model engineers society in london  where it delivered a speech  invented by w  h  richards  the robot s frame consisted of an aluminium body of armour with eleven electromagnets and one motor powered by a twelve volt power source  the robot could move its hands and head and could be controlled through remote control or voice control  both eric and his  brother  george toured the world  westinghouse electric corporation built televox in 1926  it was a cardboard cutout connected to various devices which users could turn on and off  in 1939  the humanoid robot known as elektro was debuted at the 1939 new york world s fair  seven feet tall  2 1 m  and weighing 265 pounds  120 2 kg   it could walk by voice command  speak about 700 words  using a 78 rpm record player   smoke cigarettes  blow up balloons  and move its head and arms  the body consisted of a steel gear  cam and motor skeleton covered by an aluminum skin  in 1928  japan s first robot  gakutensoku  was designed and constructed by biologist makoto nishimura 

the first electronic autonomous robots with complex behaviour were created by william grey walter of the burden neurological institute at bristol  england in 1948 and 1949  he wanted to prove that rich connections between a small number of brain cells could give rise to very complex behaviors – essentially that the secret of how the brain worked lay in how it was wired up  his first robots  named elmer and elsie  were constructed between 1948 and 1949 and were often described as tortoises due to their shape and slow rate of movement  the three wheeled tortoise robots were capable of phototaxis  by which they could find their way to a recharging station when they ran low on battery power  walter stressed the importance of using purely electronics to simulate brain processes at a time when his contemporaries such as alan turing and john von neumann were all turning towards a view of mental processes in terms of digital computation  his work inspired subsequent generations of robotics researchers such as rodney brooks  hans moravec and mark tilden  modern incarnations of walter s turtles may be found in the form of beam robotics  the first digitally operated and programmable robot was invented by george devol in 1954 and was ultimately called the unimate  this ultimately laid the foundations of the modern robotics industry  devol sold the first unimate to general motors in 1960  and it was installed in 1961 in a plant in trenton  new jersey to lift hot pieces of metal from a die casting machine and stack them  devol s patent for the first digitally operated programmable robotic arm represents the foundation of the modern robotics industry  the first palletizing robot was introduced in 1963 by the fuji yusoki kogyo company  in 1973  a robot with six electromechanically driven axes was patented   by kuka robotics in germany  and the programmable universal manipulation arm was invented by victor scheinman in 1976  and the design was sold to unimation  commercial and industrial robots are now in widespread use performing jobs more cheaply or with greater accuracy and reliability than humans  they are also employed for jobs which are too dirty  dangerous or dull to be suitable for humans  robots are widely used in manufacturing  assembly and packing  transport  earth and space exploration  surgery  weaponry  laboratory research  and mass production of consumer and industrial goods 

various techniques have emerged to develop the science of robotics and robots  one method is evolutionary robotics  in which a number of differing robots are submitted to tests  those which perform best are used as a model to create a subsequent  generation  of robots  another method is developmental robotics  which tracks changes and development within a single robot in the areas of problem solving and other functions  another new type of robot is just recently introduced which acts both as a smartphone and robot and is named robohon  as robots become more advanced  eventually there may be a standard computer operating system designed mainly for robots  robot operating system is an open source set of programs being developed at stanford university  the massachusetts institute of technology and the technical university of munich  germany  among others  ros provides ways to program a robot s navigation and limbs regardless of the specific hardware involved  it also provides high level commands for items like image recognition and even opening doors  when ros boots up on a robot s computer  it would obtain data on attributes such as the length and movement of robots  limbs  it would relay this data to higher level algorithms  microsoft is also developing a  windows for robots  system with its robotics developer studio  which has been available since 2007  japan hopes to have full scale commercialization of service robots by 2025  much technological research in japan is led by japanese government agencies  particularly the trade ministry  many future applications of robotics seem obvious to people  even though they are well beyond the capabilities of robots available at the time of the prediction  as early as 1982 people were confident that someday robots would  1  clean parts by removing molding flash 2  spray paint automobiles with absolutely no human presence 3  pack things in boxes—for example  orient and nest chocolate candies in candy boxes 4  make electrical cable harness 5  load trucks with boxes—a packing problem 6  handle soft goods  such as garments and shoes 7  shear sheep 8  prosthesis 9  cook fast food and work in other service industries 10  household robot  generally such predictions are overly optimistic in timescale 

in 2008  caterpillar inc  developed a dump truck which can drive itself without any human operator  many analysts believe that self driving trucks may eventually revolutionize logistics  by 2014  caterpillar had a self driving dump truck which is expected to greatly change the process of mining  in 2015  these caterpillar trucks were actively used in mining operations in australia by the mining company rio tinto coal australia  some analysts believe that within the next few decades  most trucks will be self driving  a literate or  reading robot  named marge has intelligence that comes from software  she can read newspapers  find and correct misspelled words  learn about banks like barclays  and understand that some restaurants are better places to eat than others  baxter is a new robot introduced in 2012 which learns by guidance  a worker could teach baxter how to perform a task by moving its hands in the desired motion and having baxter memorize them  extra dials  buttons  and controls are available on baxter s arm for more precision and features  any regular worker could program baxter and it only takes a matter of minutes  unlike usual industrial robots that take extensive programs and coding in order to be used  this means baxter needs no programming in order to operate  no software engineers are needed  this also means baxter can be taught to perform multiple  more complicated tasks  sawyer was added in 2015 for smaller  more precise tasks 

the word robot was introduced to the public by the czech interwar writer karel čapek in his play   r u r   rossum s universal robots     published in 1920  the play begins in a factory that uses a chemical substitute for protoplasm to manufacture living  simplified people called robots  the play does not focus in detail on the technology behind the creation of these living creatures  but in their appearance they prefigure modern ideas of androids  creatures who can be mistaken for humans  these mass produced workers are depicted as efficient but emotionless  incapable of original thinking and indifferent to self preservation  at issue is whether the robots are being exploited and the consequences of human dependence upon commodified labor  especially after a number of specially formulated robots achieve self awareness and incite robots all around the world to rise up against the humans   karel čapek himself did not coin the word  he wrote a short letter in reference to an etymology in the oxford english dictionary in which he named his brother  the painter and writer josef čapek  as its actual originator  in an article in the czech journal lidové noviny in 1933  he explained that he had originally wanted to call the creatures laboři   workers   from latin labor   however  he did not like the word  and sought advice from his brother josef  who suggested  roboti   the word robota means literally  corvée    serf labor   and figuratively  drudgery  or  hard work  in czech and also  more general   work    labor  in many slavic languages  e g   bulgarian  russian  serbian  slovak  polish  macedonian  ukrainian  archaic czech  as well as robot in hungarian   traditionally the robota  hungarian robot  was the work period a serf  corvée  had to give for his lord  typically 6 months of the year  the origin of the word is the old church slavonic  old bulgarian  rabota  servitude    work  in contemporary bulgarian and russian   which in turn comes from the proto indo european root  orbh   robot is cognate with the german root arbeit  work   the word robotics  used to describe this field of study  was coined by the science fiction writer isaac asimov  asimov created the  three laws of robotics  which are a recurring theme in his books  these have since been used by many others to define laws used in fiction   the three laws are pure fiction  and no technology yet created has the ability to understand or follow them  and in fact most robots serve military purposes  which run quite contrary to the first law and often the third law   people think about asimov s laws  but they were set up to point out how a simple ethical system doesn t work  if you read the short stories  every single one is about a failure  and they are totally impractical   said dr  joanna bryson of the university of bath   



mobile robots have the capability to move around in their environment and are not fixed to one physical location  an example of a mobile robot that is in common use today is the automated guided vehicle or automatic guided vehicle  agv   an agv is a mobile robot that follows markers or wires in the floor  or uses vision or lasers  agvs are discussed later in this article  mobile robots are also found in industry  military and security environments  they also appear as consumer products  for entertainment or to perform certain tasks like vacuum cleaning  mobile robots are the focus of a great deal of current research and almost every major university has one or more labs that focus on mobile robot research  mobile robots are usually used in tightly controlled environments such as on assembly lines because they have difficulty responding to unexpected interference  because of this most humans rarely encounter robots  however domestic robots for cleaning and maintenance are increasingly common in and around homes in developed countries  robots can also be found in military applications 

industrial robots usually consist of a jointed arm  multi linked manipulator  and an end effector that is attached to a fixed surface  one of the most common type of end effector is a gripper assembly  the international organization for standardization gives a definition of a manipulating industrial robot in iso 8373   an automatically controlled  reprogrammable  multipurpose  manipulator programmable in three or more axes  which may be either fixed in place or mobile for use in industrial automation applications   this definition is used by the international federation of robotics  the european robotics research network  euron  and many national standards committees  <  see talk page as riofa is in disute  the robotics institute of america  ria  uses a broader definition  a robot is a  re programmable multi functional manipulator designed to move materials  parts  tools  or specialized devices through variable programmed motions for the performance of a variety of tasks   the ria subdivides robots into four classes  devices that manipulate objects with manual control  automated devices that manipulate objects with predetermined cycles  programmable and servo controlled robots with continuous point to point trajectories  and robots of this last type which also acquire information from the environment and move intelligently in response    >

most commonly industrial robots are fixed robotic arms and manipulators used primarily for production and distribution of goods  the term  service robot  is less well defined  the international federation of robotics has proposed a tentative definition   a service robot is a robot which operates semi  or fully autonomously to perform services useful to the well being of humans and equipment  excluding manufacturing operations  

robots are used as educational assistants to teachers  from the 1980s  robots such as turtles were used in schools and programmed using the logo language  there are robot kits like lego mindstorms  bioloid  ollo from robotis  or botbrain educational robots can help children to learn about mathematics  physics  programming  and electronics  robotics have also been introduced into the lives of elementary and high school students in the form of robot competitions with the company first  for inspiration and recognition of science and technology   the organization is the foundation for the first robotics competition  first lego league  junior first lego league  and first tech challenge competitions  there have also been devices shaped like robots such as the teaching computer  leachim  1974   and 2 xl  1976   a robot shaped game   teaching toy based on an 8 track tape player  both invented michael j  freeman 

modular robots are a new breed of robots that are designed to increase the utilization of robots by modularizing their architecture  the functionality and effectiveness of a modular robot is easier to increase compared to conventional robots  these robots are composed of a single type of identical  several different identical module types  or similarly shaped modules  which vary in size  their architectural structure allows hyper redundancy for modular robots  as they can be designed with more than 8 degrees of freedom  dof   creating the programming  inverse kinematics and dynamics for modular robots is more complex than with traditional robots  modular robots may be composed of l shaped modules  cubic modules  and u and h shaped modules  anat technology  an early modular robotic technology patented by robotics design inc   allows the creation of modular robots from u and h shaped modules that connect in a chain  and are used to form heterogeneous and homogenous modular robot systems  these  anat robots  can be designed with  n  dof as each module is a complete motorized robotic system that folds relatively to the modules connected before and after it in its chain  and therefore a single module allows one degree of freedom  the more modules that are connected to one another  the more degrees of freedom it will have  l shaped modules can also be designed in a chain  and must become increasingly smaller as the size of the chain increases  as payloads attached to the end of the chain place a greater strain on modules that are further from the base  anat h shaped modules do not suffer from this problem  as their design allows a modular robot to distribute pressure and impacts evenly amongst other attached modules  and therefore payload carrying capacity does not decrease as the length of the arm increases  modular robots can be manually or self reconfigured to form a different robot  that may perform different applications  because modular robots of the same architecture type are composed of modules that compose different modular robots  a snake arm robot can combine with another to form a dual or quadra arm robot  or can split into several mobile robots  and mobile robots can split into multiple smaller ones  or combine with others into a larger or different one  this allows a single modular robot the ability to be fully specialized in a single task  as well as the capacity to be specialized to perform multiple different tasks  modular robotic technology is currently being applied in hybrid transportation  industrial automation  duct cleaning and handling  many research centres and universities have also studied this technology  and have developed prototypes 

a collaborative robot or cobot is a robot that can safely and effectively interact with human workers while performing simple industrial tasks  however  end effectors and other environmental conditions may create hazards  and as such risk assessments should be done before using any industrial motion control application  the collaborative robots most widely used in industries today are manufactured by universal robots in denmark  rethink robotics—founded by rodney brooks  previously with irobot—introduced baxter in september 2012  as an industrial robot designed to safely interact with neighboring human workers  and be programmable for performing simple tasks  baxters stop if they detect a human in the way of their robotic arms and have prominent off switches  intended for sale to small businesses  they are promoted as the robotic analogue of the personal computer    190 companies in the us have bought baxters and they are being used commercially in the uk 

roughly half of all the robots in the world are in asia  32  in europe  and 16  in north america  1  in australasia and 1  in africa  40  of all the robots in the world are in japan  making japan the country with the highest number of robots 

as robots have become more advanced and sophisticated  experts and academics have increasingly explored the questions of what ethics might govern robots  behavior  and whether robots might be able to claim any kind of social  cultural  ethical or legal rights  one scientific team has said that it is possible that a robot brain will exist by 2019  others predict robot intelligence breakthroughs by 2050  recent advances have made robotic behavior more sophisticated  the social impact of intelligent robots is subject of a 2010 documentary film called plug   pray  vernor vinge has suggested that a moment may come when computers and robots are smarter than humans  he calls this  the singularity   he suggests that it may be somewhat or possibly very dangerous for humans  this is discussed by a philosophy called singularitarianism  in 2009  experts attended a conference hosted by the association for the advancement of artificial intelligence  aaai  to discuss whether computers and robots might be able to acquire any autonomy  and how much these abilities might pose a threat or hazard  they noted that some robots have acquired various forms of semi autonomy  including being able to find power sources on their own and being able to independently choose targets to attack with weapons  they also noted that some computer viruses can evade elimination and have achieved  cockroach intelligence   they noted that self awareness as depicted in science fiction is probably unlikely  but that there were other potential hazards and pitfalls  various media sources and scientific groups have noted separate trends in differing areas which might together result in greater robotic functionalities and autonomy  and which pose some inherent concerns  in 2015  the nao alderen robots were shown to have a capability for a degree of self awareness  researchers at the rensselaer polytechnic institute ai and reasoning lab in new york conducted an experiment where a robot became aware of itself  and corrected its answer to a question once it had realised this 

some experts and academics have questioned the use of robots for military combat  especially when such robots are given some degree of autonomous functions  there are also concerns about technology which might allow some armed robots to be controlled mainly by other robots  the us navy has funded a report which indicates that  as military robots become more complex  there should be greater attention to implications of their ability to make autonomous decisions  one researcher states that autonomous robots might be more humane  as they could make decisions more effectively  however  other experts question this  one robot in particular  the eatr  has generated public concerns over its fuel source  as it can continually refuel itself using organic substances  although the engine for the eatr is designed to run on biomass and vegetation specifically selected by its sensors  which it can find on battlefields or other local environments  the project has stated that chicken fat can also be used  manuel de landa has noted that  smart missiles  and autonomous bombs equipped with artificial perception can be considered robots  as they make some of their decisions autonomously  he believes this represents an important and dangerous trend in which humans are handing over important decisions to machines 

for centuries  people have predicted that machines would make workers obsolete and increase unemployment  although the causes of unemployment are usually thought to be due to social policy  a recent example of human replacement involves taiwanese technology company foxconn who  in july 2011  announced a three year plan to replace workers with more robots  at present the company uses ten thousand robots but will increase them to a million robots over a three year period  lawyers have speculated that an increased prevalence of robots in the workplace could lead to the need to improve redundancy laws  kevin j  delaney said  robots are taking human jobs  but bill gates believes that governments should tax companies’ use of them  as a way to at least temporarily slow the spread of automation and to fund other types of employment   the robot tax would also help pay a guaranteed living wage to the displaced workers 

at present  there are two main types of robots  based on their use  general purpose autonomous robots and dedicated robots  robots can be classified by their specificity of purpose  a robot might be designed to perform one particular task extremely well  or a range of tasks less well  all robots by their nature can be re programmed to behave differently  but some are limited by their physical form  for example  a factory robot arm can perform jobs such as cutting  welding  gluing  or acting as a fairground ride  while a pick and place robot can only populate printed circuit boards 

general purpose autonomous robots can perform a variety of functions independently  general purpose autonomous robots typically can navigate independently in known spaces  handle their own re charging needs  interface with electronic doors and elevators and perform other basic tasks  like computers  general purpose robots can link with networks  software and accessories that increase their usefulness  they may recognize people or objects  talk  provide companionship  monitor environmental quality  respond to alarms  pick up supplies and perform other useful tasks  general purpose robots may perform a variety of functions simultaneously or they may take on different roles at different times of day  some such robots try to mimic human beings and may even resemble people in appearance  this type of robot is called a humanoid robot  humanoid robots are still in a very limited stage  as no humanoid robot can  as of yet  actually navigate around a room that it has never been in  thus  humanoid robots are really quite limited  despite their intelligent behaviors in their well known environments 



over the last three decades  automobile factories have become dominated by robots  a typical factory contains hundreds of industrial robots working on fully automated production lines  with one robot for every ten human workers  on an automated production line  a vehicle chassis on a conveyor is welded  glued  painted and finally assembled at a sequence of robot stations 

industrial robots are also used extensively for palletizing and packaging of manufactured goods  for example for rapidly taking drink cartons from the end of a conveyor belt and placing them into boxes  or for loading and unloading machining centers 

mass produced printed circuit boards  pcbs  are almost exclusively manufactured by pick and place robots  typically with scara manipulators  which remove tiny electronic components from strips or trays  and place them on to pcbs with great accuracy  such robots can place hundreds of thousands of components per hour  far out performing a human in speed  accuracy  and reliability 

mobile robots  following markers or wires in the floor  or using vision or lasers  are used to transport goods around large facilities  such as warehouses  container ports  or hospitals 

limited to tasks that could be accurately defined and had to be performed the same way every time  very little feedback or intelligence was required  and the robots needed only the most basic  sensors   the limitations of these agvs are that their paths are not easily altered and they cannot alter their paths if obstacles block them  if one agv breaks down  it may stop the entire operation 

developed to deploy triangulation from beacons or bar code grids for scanning on the floor or ceiling  in most factories  triangulation systems tend to require moderate to high maintenance  such as daily cleaning of all beacons or bar codes  also  if a tall pallet or large vehicle blocks beacons or a bar code is marred  agvs may become lost  often such agvs are designed to be used in human free environments 

such as smartloader  speciminder  adam  tug eskorta  and mt 400 with motivity are designed for people friendly workspaces  they navigate by recognizing natural features  3d scanners or other means of sensing the environment in two or three dimensions help to eliminate cumulative errors in dead reckoning calculations of the agv s current position  some agvs can create maps of their environment using scanning lasers with simultaneous localization and mapping  slam  and use those maps to navigate in real time with other path planning and obstacle avoidance algorithms  they are able to operate in complex environments and perform non repetitive and non sequential tasks such as transporting photomasks in a semiconductor lab  specimens in hospitals and goods in warehouses  for dynamic areas  such as warehouses full of pallets  agvs require additional strategies using three dimensional sensors such as time of flight or stereovision cameras 

there are many jobs which humans would rather leave to robots  the job may be boring  such as domestic cleaning  or dangerous  such as exploring inside a volcano  other jobs are physically inaccessible  such as exploring another planet  cleaning the inside of a long pipe  or performing laparoscopic surgery 

almost every unmanned space probe ever launched was a robot  some were launched in the 1960s with very limited abilities  but their ability to fly and land  in the case of luna 9  is an indication of their status as a robot  this includes the voyager probes and the galileo probes  among others 

teleoperated robots  or telerobots  are devices remotely operated from a distance by a human operator rather than following a predetermined sequence of movements  but which has semi autonomous behaviour  they are used when a human cannot be present on site to perform a job because it is dangerous  far away  or inaccessible  the robot may be in another room or another country  or may be on a very different scale to the operator  for instance  a laparoscopic surgery robot allows the surgeon to work inside a human patient on a relatively small scale compared to open surgery  significantly shortening recovery time  they can also be used to avoid exposing workers to the hazardous and tight spaces such as in duct cleaning <      > when disabling a bomb  the operator sends a small robot to disable it  several authors have been using a device called the longpen to sign books remotely  teleoperated robot aircraft  like the predator unmanned aerial vehicle  are increasingly being used by the military  these pilotless drones can search terrain and fire on targets  hundreds of robots such as irobot s packbot and the foster miller talon are being used in iraq and afghanistan by the u s  military to defuse roadside bombs or improvised explosive devices  ieds  in an activity known as explosive ordnance disposal  eod  

robots are used to automate picking fruit on orchards at a cost lower than that of human pickers 

domestic robots are simple robots dedicated to a single task work in home use  they are used in simple but unwanted jobs  such as vacuum cleaning  floor washing  and lawn mowing  an example of a domestic robot is a roomba 

military robots include the swords robot which is currently used in ground based combat  it can use a variety of weapons and there is some discussion of giving it some degree of autonomy in battleground situations  unmanned combat air vehicles  ucavs   which are an upgraded form of uavs  can do a wide variety of missions  including combat  ucavs are being designed such as the bae systems mantis which would have the ability to fly themselves  to pick their own course and target  and to make most decisions on their own  the bae taranis is a ucav built by great britain which can fly across continents without a pilot and has new means to avoid detection  flight trials are expected to begin in 2011  the aaai has studied this topic in depth and its president has commissioned a study to look at this issue  some have suggested a need to build  friendly ai   meaning that the advances which are already occurring with ai should also include an effort to make ai intrinsically friendly and humane  several such measures reportedly already exist  with robot heavy countries such as japan and south korea having begun to pass regulations requiring robots to be equipped with safety systems  and possibly sets of  laws  akin to asimov s three laws of robotics  an official report was issued in 2009 by the japanese government s robot industry policy committee  chinese officials and researchers have issued a report suggesting a set of ethical rules  and a set of new legal guidelines referred to as  robot legal studies   some concern has been expressed over a possible occurrence of robots telling apparent falsehoods 

mining robots are designed to solve a number of problems currently facing the mining industry  including skills shortages  improving productivity from declining ore grades  and achieving environmental targets  due to the hazardous nature of mining  in particular underground mining  the prevalence of autonomous  semi autonomous  and tele operated robots has greatly increased in recent times  a number of vehicle manufacturers provide autonomous trains  trucks and loaders that will load material  transport it on the mine site to its destination  and unload without requiring human intervention  one of the world s largest mining corporations  rio tinto  has recently expanded its autonomous truck fleet to the world s largest  consisting of 150 autonomous komatsu trucks  operating in western australia  similarly  bhp has announced the expansion of its autonomous drill fleet to the world s largest  21 autonomous atlas copco drills  drilling  longwall and rockbreaking machines are now also available as autonomous robots  the atlas copco rig control system can autonomously execute a drilling plan on a drilling rig  moving the rig into position using gps  set up the drill rig and drill down to specified depths  similarly  the transmin rocklogic system can automatically plan a path to position a rockbreaker at a selected destination  these systems greatly enhance the safety and efficiency of mining operations 

robots in healthcare have two main functions  those which assist an individual  such as a sufferer of a disease like multiple sclerosis  and those which aid in the overall systems such as pharmacies and hospitals 

robots used in home automation have developed over time from simple basic robotic assistants  such as the handy 1  through to semi autonomous robots  such as friend which can assist the elderly and disabled with common tasks  the population is aging in many countries  especially japan  meaning that there are increasing numbers of elderly people to care for  but relatively fewer young people to care for them  humans make the best carers  but where they are unavailable  robots are gradually being introduced  friend is a semi autonomous robot designed to support disabled and elderly people in their daily life activities  like preparing and serving a meal  friend make it possible for patients who are paraplegic  have muscle diseases or serious paralysis  due to strokes etc    to perform tasks without help from other people like therapists or nursing staff 

script pro manufactures a robot designed to help pharmacies fill prescriptions that consist of oral solids or medications in pill form  the pharmacist or pharmacy technician enters the prescription information into its information system  the system  upon determining whether or not the drug is in the robot  will send the information to the robot for filling  the robot has 3 different size vials to fill determined by the size of the pill  the robot technician  user  or pharmacist determines the needed size of the vial based on the tablet when the robot is stocked  once the vial is filled it is brought up to a conveyor belt that delivers it to a holder that spins the vial and attaches the patient label  afterwards it is set on another conveyor that delivers the patient s medication vial to a slot labeled with the patient s name on an led read out  the pharmacist or technician then checks the contents of the vial to ensure it s the correct drug for the correct patient and then seals the vials and sends it out front to be picked up  the robot is a very time efficient device that the pharmacy depends on to fill prescriptions  mckesson s robot rx is another healthcare robotics product that helps pharmacies dispense thousands of medications daily with little or no errors  the robot can be ten feet wide and thirty feet long and can hold hundreds of different kinds of medications and thousands of doses  the pharmacy saves many resources like staff members that are otherwise unavailable in a resource scarce industry  it uses an electromechanical head coupled with a pneumatic system to capture each dose and deliver it to its either stocked or dispensed location  the head moves along a single axis while it rotates 180 degrees to pull the medications  during this process it uses barcode technology to verify its pulling the correct drug  it then delivers the drug to a patient specific bin on a conveyor belt  once the bin is filled with all of the drugs that a particular patient needs and that the robot stocks  the bin is then released and returned out on the conveyor belt to a technician waiting to load it into a cart for delivery to the floor 

while most robots today are installed in factories or homes  performing labour or life saving jobs  many new types of robot are being developed in laboratories around the world  much of the research in robotics focuses not on specific industrial tasks  but on investigations into new types of robot  alternative ways to think about or design robots  and new ways to manufacture them  it is expected that these new types of robot will be able to solve real world problems when they are finally realized 

one approach to designing robots is to base them on animals  bionickangaroo was designed and engineered by studying and applying the physiology and methods of locomotion of a kangaroo 

nanorobotics is the emerging technology field of creating machines or robots whose components are at or close to the microscopic scale of a nanometer  10 −9 meters   also known as  nanobots  or  nanites   they would be constructed from molecular machines  so far  researchers have mostly produced only parts of these complex systems  such as bearings  sensors  and synthetic molecular motors  but functioning robots have also been made such as the entrants to the nanobot robocup contest  researchers also hope to be able to create entire robots as small as viruses or bacteria  which could perform tasks on a tiny scale  possible applications include micro surgery  on the level of individual cells   utility fog  manufacturing  weaponry and cleaning  some people have suggested that if there were nanobots which could reproduce  the earth would turn into  grey goo   while others argue that this hypothetical outcome is nonsense 

a few researchers have investigated the possibility of creating robots which can alter their physical form to suit a particular task  like the fictional t 1000  real robots are nowhere near that sophisticated however  and mostly consist of a small number of cube shaped units  which can move relative to their neighbours  algorithms have been designed in case any such robots become a reality 

robots with silicone bodies and flexible actuators  air muscles  electroactive polymers  and ferrofluids  look and feel different from robots with rigid skeletons  and can have different behaviors 

inspired by colonies of insects such as ants and bees  researchers are modeling the behavior of swarms of thousands of tiny robots which together perform a useful task  such as finding something hidden  cleaning  or spying  each robot is quite simple  but the emergent behavior of the swarm is more complex  the whole set of robots can be considered as one single distributed system  in the same way an ant colony can be considered a superorganism  exhibiting swarm intelligence  the largest swarms so far created include the irobot swarm  the sri mobilerobots centibots project and the open source micro robotic project swarm  which are being used to research collective behaviors  swarms are also more resistant to failure  whereas one large robot may fail and ruin a mission  a swarm can continue even if several robots fail  this could make them attractive for space exploration missions  where failure is normally extremely costly 

robotics also has application in the design of virtual reality interfaces  specialized robots are in widespread use in the haptic research community  these robots  called  haptic interfaces   allow touch enabled user interaction with real and virtual environments  robotic forces allow simulating the mechanical properties of  virtual  objects  which users can experience through their sense of touch 



robotic characters  androids  artificial men women  or gynoids  artificial women   and cyborgs  also  bionic men women   or humans with significant mechanical enhancements  have become a staple of science fiction  the first reference in western literature to mechanical servants appears in homer s iliad  in book xviii  hephaestus  god of fire  creates new armor for the hero achilles  assisted by robots  according to the rieu translation   golden maidservants hastened to help their master  they looked like real women and could not only speak and use their limbs but were endowed with intelligence and trained in handwork by the immortal gods   the words  robot  or  android  are not used to describe them  but they are nevertheless mechanical devices human in appearance   the first use of the word robot was in karel čapek s play r u r   rossum s universal robots   written in 1920    writer karel čapek was born in czechoslovakia  czech republic   possibly the most prolific author of the twentieth century was isaac asimov  1920–1992  who published over five hundred books  asimov is probably best remembered for his science fiction stories and especially those about robots  where he placed robots and their interaction with society at the center of many of his works  asimov carefully considered the problem of the ideal set of instructions robots might be given in order to lower the risk to humans  and arrived at his three laws of robotics  a robot may not injure a human being or  through inaction  allow a human being to come to harm  a robot must obey orders given it by human beings  except where such orders would conflict with the first law  and a robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the first or second law  these were introduced in his 1942 short story  runaround   although foreshadowed in a few earlier stories  later  asimov added the zeroth law   a robot may not harm humanity  or  by inaction  allow humanity to come to harm   the rest of the laws are modified sequentially to acknowledge this  according to the oxford english dictionary  the first passage in asimov s short story  liar    1941  that mentions the first law is the earliest recorded use of the word robotics  asimov was not initially aware of this  he assumed the word already existed by analogy with mechanics  hydraulics  and other similar terms denoting branches of applied knowledge 

robots appear in many films  most of the robots in cinema are fictional  two of the most famous are r2 d2 and c 3po from the star wars franchise 

the concept of humanoid sex robots has elicited both public attention and concern  opponents of the concept have stated that the development of sex robots would be morally wrong  they argue that the introduction of such devices would be socially harmful  and demeaning to women and children 

fears and concerns about robots have been repeatedly expressed in a wide range of books and films  a common theme is the development of a master race of conscious and highly intelligent robots  motivated to take over or destroy the human race  frankenstein  1818   often called the first science fiction novel  has become synonymous with the theme of a robot or android advancing beyond its creator  other works with similar themes include the mechanical man  the terminator  runaway  robocop  the replicators in stargate  the cylons in battlestar galactica  the cybermen and daleks in doctor who  the matrix  enthiran and i  robot  some fictional robots are programmed to kill and destroy  others gain superhuman intelligence and abilities by upgrading their own software and hardware  examples of popular media where the robot becomes evil are 2001  a space odyssey  red planet and enthiran  the 2017 game horizon zero dawn explores themes of robotics in warfare  robot ethics  and the ai control problem  as well as the positive or negative impact such technologies could have on the environment  another common theme is the reaction  sometimes called the  uncanny valley   of unease and even revulsion at the sight of robots that mimic humans too closely  more recently  fictional representations of artificially intelligent robots in films such as a i  artificial intelligence and ex machina and the 2016 tv adaptation of westworld have engaged audience sympathy for the robots themselves 













a robot is a machine—especially one programmable by a computer— capable of carrying out a complex series of actions automatically  robots can be guided by an external control device or the control may be embedded within  robots may be constructed to take on human form but most robots are machines designed to perform a task with no regard to how they look  robots can be autonomous or semi autonomous and range from humanoids such as honda s advanced step in innovative mobility  asimo  and tosy s tosy ping pong playing robot  topio  to industrial robots  medical operating robots  patient assist robots  dog therapy robots  collectively programmed swarm robots  uav drones such as general atomics mq 1 predator  and even microscopic nano robots  by mimicking a lifelike appearance or automating movements  a robot may convey a sense of intelligence or thought of its own  autonomous things are expected to proliferate in the coming decade  with home robotics and the autonomous car as some of the main drivers  the branch of technology that deals with the design  construction  operation  and application of robots  as well as computer systems for their control  sensory feedback  and information processing is robotics  these technologies deal with automated machines that can take the place of humans in dangerous environments or manufacturing processes  or resemble humans in appearance  behavior  or cognition  many of today s robots are inspired by nature contributing to the field of bio inspired robotics  these robots have also created a newer branch of robotics  soft robotics  from the time of ancient civilization there have been many accounts of user configurable automated devices and even automata resembling animals and humans  designed primarily as entertainment  as mechanical techniques developed through the industrial age  there appeared more practical applications such as automated machines  remote control and wireless remote control  the term comes from a czech word  robota  meaning  forced labor   the word  robot  was first used to denote a fictional humanoid in a 1920 play r u r  by the czech writer  karel čapek but it was karel s brother josef čapek who was the word s true inventor  electronics evolved into the driving force of development with the advent of the first electronic autonomous robots created by william grey walter in bristol  england in 1948  as well as computer numerical control  cnc  machine tools in the late 1940s by john t  parsons and frank l  stulen  the first commercial  digital and programmable robot was built by george devol in 1954 and was named the unimate  it was sold to general motors in 1961 where it was used to lift pieces of hot metal from die casting machines at the inland fisher guide plant in the west trenton section of ewing township  new jersey  robots have replaced humans in performing repetitive and dangerous tasks which humans prefer not to do  or are unable to do because of size limitations  or which take place in extreme environments such as outer space or the bottom of the sea  there are concerns about the increasing use of robots and their role in society  robots are blamed for rising technological unemployment as they replace workers in increasing numbers of functions  the use of robots in military combat raises ethical concerns  the possibilities of robot autonomy and potential repercussions have been addressed in fiction and may be a realistic concern in the future 

the word robot can refer to both physical robots and virtual software agents  but the latter are usually referred to as bots  there is no consensus on which machines qualify as robots but there is general agreement among experts  and the public  that robots tend to possess some or all of the following abilities and functions  accept electronic programming  process data or physical perceptions electronically  operate autonomously to some degree  move around  operate physical parts of itself or physical processes  sense and manipulate their environment  and exhibit intelligent behavior  especially behavior which mimics humans or other animals  closely related to the concept of a robot is the field of synthetic biology  which studies entities whose nature is more comparable to beings than to machines 

the idea of automata originates in the mythologies of many cultures around the world  engineers and inventors from ancient civilizations  including ancient china  ancient greece  and ptolemaic egypt  attempted to build self operating machines  some resembling animals and humans  early descriptions of automata include the artificial doves of archytas  the artificial birds of mozi and lu ban  a  speaking  automaton by hero of alexandria  a washstand automaton by philo of byzantium  and a human automaton described in the lie zi 

many ancient mythologies  and most modern religions include artificial people  such as the mechanical servants built by the greek god hephaestus  vulcan to the romans   the clay golems of jewish legend and clay giants of norse legend  and galatea  the mythical statue of pygmalion that came to life  since circa 400 bc  myths of crete include talos  a man of bronze who guarded the cretan island of europa from pirates  in ancient greece  the greek engineer ctesibius  c  270 bc   applied a knowledge of pneumatics and hydraulics to produce the first organ and water clocks with moving figures   in the 4th century bc  the greek mathematician archytas of tarentum postulated a mechanical steam operated bird he called  the pigeon   hero of alexandria  10–70 ad   a greek mathematician and inventor  created numerous user configurable automated devices  and described machines powered by air pressure  steam and water  the 11th century lokapannatti tells of how the buddha s relics were protected by mechanical robots  bhuta vahana yanta   from the kingdom of roma visaya  rome   until they were disarmed by king ashoka  in ancient china  the 3rd century text of the lie zi describes an account of humanoid automata  involving a much earlier encounter between chinese emperor king mu of zhou and a mechanical engineer known as yan shi  an  artificer   yan shi proudly presented the king with a life size  human shaped figure of his mechanical  handiwork  made of leather  wood  and artificial organs  there are also accounts of flying automata in the han fei zi and other texts  which attributes the 5th century bc mohist philosopher mozi and his contemporary lu ban with the invention of artificial wooden birds  ma yuan  that could successfully fly  in 1066  the chinese inventor su song built a water clock in the form of a tower which featured mechanical figurines which chimed the hours  the beginning of automata is associated with the invention of early su song s astronomical clock tower featured mechanical figurines that chimed the hours  his mechanism had a programmable drum machine with pegs  cams  that bumped into little levers that operated percussion instruments  the drummer could be made to play different rhythms and different drum patterns by moving the pegs to different locations  samarangana sutradhara  a sanskrit treatise by bhoja  11th century   includes a chapter about the construction of mechanical contrivances  automata   including mechanical bees and birds  fountains shaped like humans and animals  and male and female dolls that refilled oil lamps  danced  played instruments  and re enacted scenes from hindu mythology  in renaissance italy  leonardo da vinci  1452–1519  sketched plans for a humanoid robot around 1495  da vinci s notebooks  rediscovered in the 1950s  contained detailed drawings of a mechanical knight now known as leonardo s robot  able to sit up  wave its arms and move its head and jaw  the design was probably based on anatomical research recorded in his vitruvian man  it is not known whether he attempted to build it in japan  complex animal and human automata were built between the 17th to 19th centuries  with many described in the 18th century karakuri zui  illustrated machinery  1796   one such automaton was the karakuri ningyō  a mechanized puppet  different variations of the karakuri existed  the butai karakuri  which were used in theatre  the zashiki karakuri  which were small and used in homes  and the dashi karakuri which were used in religious festivals  where the puppets were used to perform reenactments of traditional myths and legends  in france  between 1738 and 1739  jacques de vaucanson exhibited several life sized automatons  a flute player  a pipe player and a duck  the mechanical duck could flap its wings  crane its neck  and swallow food from the exhibitor s hand  and it gave the illusion of digesting its food by excreting matter stored in a hidden compartment 

remotely operated vehicles were demonstrated in the late 19th century in the form of several types of remotely controlled torpedoes  the early 1870s saw remotely controlled torpedoes by john ericsson  pneumatic   john louis lay  electric wire guided   and victor von scheliha  electric wire guided   the brennan torpedo  invented by louis brennan in 1877 was powered by two contra rotating propellors that were spun by rapidly pulling out wires from drums wound inside the torpedo  differential speed on the wires connected to the shore station allowed the torpedo to be guided to its target  making it  the world s first practical guided missile   in 1897 the british inventor ernest wilson was granted a patent for a torpedo remotely controlled by  hertzian   radio  waves and in 1898 nikola tesla publicly demonstrated a wireless controlled torpedo that he hoped to sell to the us navy  archibald low  known as the  father of radio guidance systems  for his pioneering work on guided rockets and planes during the first world war  in 1917  he demonstrated a remote controlled aircraft to the royal flying corps and in the same year built the first wire guided rocket 

 robot  was first applied as a term for artificial automata in a 1920 play r u r  by the czech writer  karel čapek  however  josef čapek was named by his brother karel as the true inventor of the term robot  the word  robot  itself was not new  having been in slavic language as robota  forced laborer   a term which classified those peasants obligated to compulsory service under the feudal system widespread in 19th century europe  see  robot patent   čapek s fictional story postulated the technological creation of artificial human bodies without souls  and the old theme of the feudal robota class eloquently fit the imagination of a new class of manufactured  artificial workers 

in 1928  one of the first humanoid robots  eric  was exhibited at the annual exhibition of the model engineers society in london  where it delivered a speech  invented by w  h  richards  the robot s frame consisted of an aluminium body of armour with eleven electromagnets and one motor powered by a twelve volt power source  the robot could move its hands and head and could be controlled through remote control or voice control  both eric and his  brother  george toured the world  westinghouse electric corporation built televox in 1926  it was a cardboard cutout connected to various devices which users could turn on and off  in 1939  the humanoid robot known as elektro was debuted at the 1939 new york world s fair  seven feet tall  2 1 m  and weighing 265 pounds  120 2 kg   it could walk by voice command  speak about 700 words  using a 78 rpm record player   smoke cigarettes  blow up balloons  and move its head and arms  the body consisted of a steel gear  cam and motor skeleton covered by an aluminum skin  in 1928  japan s first robot  gakutensoku  was designed and constructed by biologist makoto nishimura 

the first electronic autonomous robots with complex behaviour were created by william grey walter of the burden neurological institute at bristol  england in 1948 and 1949  he wanted to prove that rich connections between a small number of brain cells could give rise to very complex behaviors – essentially that the secret of how the brain worked lay in how it was wired up  his first robots  named elmer and elsie  were constructed between 1948 and 1949 and were often described as tortoises due to their shape and slow rate of movement  the three wheeled tortoise robots were capable of phototaxis  by which they could find their way to a recharging station when they ran low on battery power  walter stressed the importance of using purely electronics to simulate brain processes at a time when his contemporaries such as alan turing and john von neumann were all turning towards a view of mental processes in terms of digital computation  his work inspired subsequent generations of robotics researchers such as rodney brooks  hans moravec and mark tilden  modern incarnations of walter s turtles may be found in the form of beam robotics  the first digitally operated and programmable robot was invented by george devol in 1954 and was ultimately called the unimate  this ultimately laid the foundations of the modern robotics industry  devol sold the first unimate to general motors in 1960  and it was installed in 1961 in a plant in trenton  new jersey to lift hot pieces of metal from a die casting machine and stack them  devol s patent for the first digitally operated programmable robotic arm represents the foundation of the modern robotics industry  the first palletizing robot was introduced in 1963 by the fuji yusoki kogyo company  in 1973  a robot with six electromechanically driven axes was patented   by kuka robotics in germany  and the programmable universal manipulation arm was invented by victor scheinman in 1976  and the design was sold to unimation  commercial and industrial robots are now in widespread use performing jobs more cheaply or with greater accuracy and reliability than humans  they are also employed for jobs which are too dirty  dangerous or dull to be suitable for humans  robots are widely used in manufacturing  assembly and packing  transport  earth and space exploration  surgery  weaponry  laboratory research  and mass production of consumer and industrial goods 

various techniques have emerged to develop the science of robotics and robots  one method is evolutionary robotics  in which a number of differing robots are submitted to tests  those which perform best are used as a model to create a subsequent  generation  of robots  another method is developmental robotics  which tracks changes and development within a single robot in the areas of problem solving and other functions  another new type of robot is just recently introduced which acts both as a smartphone and robot and is named robohon  as robots become more advanced  eventually there may be a standard computer operating system designed mainly for robots  robot operating system is an open source set of programs being developed at stanford university  the massachusetts institute of technology and the technical university of munich  germany  among others  ros provides ways to program a robot s navigation and limbs regardless of the specific hardware involved  it also provides high level commands for items like image recognition and even opening doors  when ros boots up on a robot s computer  it would obtain data on attributes such as the length and movement of robots  limbs  it would relay this data to higher level algorithms  microsoft is also developing a  windows for robots  system with its robotics developer studio  which has been available since 2007  japan hopes to have full scale commercialization of service robots by 2025  much technological research in japan is led by japanese government agencies  particularly the trade ministry  many future applications of robotics seem obvious to people  even though they are well beyond the capabilities of robots available at the time of the prediction  as early as 1982 people were confident that someday robots would  1  clean parts by removing molding flash 2  spray paint automobiles with absolutely no human presence 3  pack things in boxes—for example  orient and nest chocolate candies in candy boxes 4  make electrical cable harness 5  load trucks with boxes—a packing problem 6  handle soft goods  such as garments and shoes 7  shear sheep 8  prosthesis 9  cook fast food and work in other service industries 10  household robot  generally such predictions are overly optimistic in timescale 

in 2008  caterpillar inc  developed a dump truck which can drive itself without any human operator  many analysts believe that self driving trucks may eventually revolutionize logistics  by 2014  caterpillar had a self driving dump truck which is expected to greatly change the process of mining  in 2015  these caterpillar trucks were actively used in mining operations in australia by the mining company rio tinto coal australia  some analysts believe that within the next few decades  most trucks will be self driving  a literate or  reading robot  named marge has intelligence that comes from software  she can read newspapers  find and correct misspelled words  learn about banks like barclays  and understand that some restaurants are better places to eat than others  baxter is a new robot introduced in 2012 which learns by guidance  a worker could teach baxter how to perform a task by moving its hands in the desired motion and having baxter memorize them  extra dials  buttons  and controls are available on baxter s arm for more precision and features  any regular worker could program baxter and it only takes a matter of minutes  unlike usual industrial robots that take extensive programs and coding in order to be used  this means baxter needs no programming in order to operate  no software engineers are needed  this also means baxter can be taught to perform multiple  more complicated tasks  sawyer was added in 2015 for smaller  more precise tasks 

the word robot was introduced to the public by the czech interwar writer karel čapek in his play   r u r   rossum s universal robots     published in 1920  the play begins in a factory that uses a chemical substitute for protoplasm to manufacture living  simplified people called robots  the play does not focus in detail on the technology behind the creation of these living creatures  but in their appearance they prefigure modern ideas of androids  creatures who can be mistaken for humans  these mass produced workers are depicted as efficient but emotionless  incapable of original thinking and indifferent to self preservation  at issue is whether the robots are being exploited and the consequences of human dependence upon commodified labor  especially after a number of specially formulated robots achieve self awareness and incite robots all around the world to rise up against the humans   karel čapek himself did not coin the word  he wrote a short letter in reference to an etymology in the oxford english dictionary in which he named his brother  the painter and writer josef čapek  as its actual originator  in an article in the czech journal lidové noviny in 1933  he explained that he had originally wanted to call the creatures laboři   workers   from latin labor   however  he did not like the word  and sought advice from his brother josef  who suggested  roboti   the word robota means literally  corvée    serf labor   and figuratively  drudgery  or  hard work  in czech and also  more general   work    labor  in many slavic languages  e g   bulgarian  russian  serbian  slovak  polish  macedonian  ukrainian  archaic czech  as well as robot in hungarian   traditionally the robota  hungarian robot  was the work period a serf  corvée  had to give for his lord  typically 6 months of the year  the origin of the word is the old church slavonic  old bulgarian  rabota  servitude    work  in contemporary bulgarian and russian   which in turn comes from the proto indo european root  orbh   robot is cognate with the german root arbeit  work   the word robotics  used to describe this field of study  was coined by the science fiction writer isaac asimov  asimov created the  three laws of robotics  which are a recurring theme in his books  these have since been used by many others to define laws used in fiction   the three laws are pure fiction  and no technology yet created has the ability to understand or follow them  and in fact most robots serve military purposes  which run quite contrary to the first law and often the third law   people think about asimov s laws  but they were set up to point out how a simple ethical system doesn t work  if you read the short stories  every single one is about a failure  and they are totally impractical   said dr  joanna bryson of the university of bath   



mobile robots have the capability to move around in their environment and are not fixed to one physical location  an example of a mobile robot that is in common use today is the automated guided vehicle or automatic guided vehicle  agv   an agv is a mobile robot that follows markers or wires in the floor  or uses vision or lasers  agvs are discussed later in this article  mobile robots are also found in industry  military and security environments  they also appear as consumer products  for entertainment or to perform certain tasks like vacuum cleaning  mobile robots are the focus of a great deal of current research and almost every major university has one or more labs that focus on mobile robot research  mobile robots are usually used in tightly controlled environments such as on assembly lines because they have difficulty responding to unexpected interference  because of this most humans rarely encounter robots  however domestic robots for cleaning and maintenance are increasingly common in and around homes in developed countries  robots can also be found in military applications 

industrial robots usually consist of a jointed arm  multi linked manipulator  and an end effector that is attached to a fixed surface  one of the most common type of end effector is a gripper assembly  the international organization for standardization gives a definition of a manipulating industrial robot in iso 8373   an automatically controlled  reprogrammable  multipurpose  manipulator programmable in three or more axes  which may be either fixed in place or mobile for use in industrial automation applications   this definition is used by the international federation of robotics  the european robotics research network  euron  and many national standards committees  <  see talk page as riofa is in disute  the robotics institute of america  ria  uses a broader definition  a robot is a  re programmable multi functional manipulator designed to move materials  parts  tools  or specialized devices through variable programmed motions for the performance of a variety of tasks   the ria subdivides robots into four classes  devices that manipulate objects with manual control  automated devices that manipulate objects with predetermined cycles  programmable and servo controlled robots with continuous point to point trajectories  and robots of this last type which also acquire information from the environment and move intelligently in response    >

most commonly industrial robots are fixed robotic arms and manipulators used primarily for production and distribution of goods  the term  service robot  is less well defined  the international federation of robotics has proposed a tentative definition   a service robot is a robot which operates semi  or fully autonomously to perform services useful to the well being of humans and equipment  excluding manufacturing operations  

robots are used as educational assistants to teachers  from the 1980s  robots such as turtles were used in schools and programmed using the logo language  there are robot kits like lego mindstorms  bioloid  ollo from robotis  or botbrain educational robots can help children to learn about mathematics  physics  programming  and electronics  robotics have also been introduced into the lives of elementary and high school students in the form of robot competitions with the company first  for inspiration and recognition of science and technology   the organization is the foundation for the first robotics competition  first lego league  junior first lego league  and first tech challenge competitions  there have also been devices shaped like robots such as the teaching computer  leachim  1974   and 2 xl  1976   a robot shaped game   teaching toy based on an 8 track tape player  both invented michael j  freeman 

modular robots are a new breed of robots that are designed to increase the utilization of robots by modularizing their architecture  the functionality and effectiveness of a modular robot is easier to increase compared to conventional robots  these robots are composed of a single type of identical  several different identical module types  or similarly shaped modules  which vary in size  their architectural structure allows hyper redundancy for modular robots  as they can be designed with more than 8 degrees of freedom  dof   creating the programming  inverse kinematics and dynamics for modular robots is more complex than with traditional robots  modular robots may be composed of l shaped modules  cubic modules  and u and h shaped modules  anat technology  an early modular robotic technology patented by robotics design inc   allows the creation of modular robots from u and h shaped modules that connect in a chain  and are used to form heterogeneous and homogenous modular robot systems  these  anat robots  can be designed with  n  dof as each module is a complete motorized robotic system that folds relatively to the modules connected before and after it in its chain  and therefore a single module allows one degree of freedom  the more modules that are connected to one another  the more degrees of freedom it will have  l shaped modules can also be designed in a chain  and must become increasingly smaller as the size of the chain increases  as payloads attached to the end of the chain place a greater strain on modules that are further from the base  anat h shaped modules do not suffer from this problem  as their design allows a modular robot to distribute pressure and impacts evenly amongst other attached modules  and therefore payload carrying capacity does not decrease as the length of the arm increases  modular robots can be manually or self reconfigured to form a different robot  that may perform different applications  because modular robots of the same architecture type are composed of modules that compose different modular robots  a snake arm robot can combine with another to form a dual or quadra arm robot  or can split into several mobile robots  and mobile robots can split into multiple smaller ones  or combine with others into a larger or different one  this allows a single modular robot the ability to be fully specialized in a single task  as well as the capacity to be specialized to perform multiple different tasks  modular robotic technology is currently being applied in hybrid transportation  industrial automation  duct cleaning and handling  many research centres and universities have also studied this technology  and have developed prototypes 

a collaborative robot or cobot is a robot that can safely and effectively interact with human workers while performing simple industrial tasks  however  end effectors and other environmental conditions may create hazards  and as such risk assessments should be done before using any industrial motion control application  the collaborative robots most widely used in industries today are manufactured by universal robots in denmark  rethink robotics—founded by rodney brooks  previously with irobot—introduced baxter in september 2012  as an industrial robot designed to safely interact with neighboring human workers  and be programmable for performing simple tasks  baxters stop if they detect a human in the way of their robotic arms and have prominent off switches  intended for sale to small businesses  they are promoted as the robotic analogue of the personal computer    190 companies in the us have bought baxters and they are being used commercially in the uk 

roughly half of all the robots in the world are in asia  32  in europe  and 16  in north america  1  in australasia and 1  in africa  40  of all the robots in the world are in japan  making japan the country with the highest number of robots 

as robots have become more advanced and sophisticated  experts and academics have increasingly explored the questions of what ethics might govern robots  behavior  and whether robots might be able to claim any kind of social  cultural  ethical or legal rights  one scientific team has said that it is possible that a robot brain will exist by 2019  others predict robot intelligence breakthroughs by 2050  recent advances have made robotic behavior more sophisticated  the social impact of intelligent robots is subject of a 2010 documentary film called plug   pray  vernor vinge has suggested that a moment may come when computers and robots are smarter than humans  he calls this  the singularity   he suggests that it may be somewhat or possibly very dangerous for humans  this is discussed by a philosophy called singularitarianism  in 2009  experts attended a conference hosted by the association for the advancement of artificial intelligence  aaai  to discuss whether computers and robots might be able to acquire any autonomy  and how much these abilities might pose a threat or hazard  they noted that some robots have acquired various forms of semi autonomy  including being able to find power sources on their own and being able to independently choose targets to attack with weapons  they also noted that some computer viruses can evade elimination and have achieved  cockroach intelligence   they noted that self awareness as depicted in science fiction is probably unlikely  but that there were other potential hazards and pitfalls  various media sources and scientific groups have noted separate trends in differing areas which might together result in greater robotic functionalities and autonomy  and which pose some inherent concerns  in 2015  the nao alderen robots were shown to have a capability for a degree of self awareness  researchers at the rensselaer polytechnic institute ai and reasoning lab in new york conducted an experiment where a robot became aware of itself  and corrected its answer to a question once it had realised this 

some experts and academics have questioned the use of robots for military combat  especially when such robots are given some degree of autonomous functions  there are also concerns about technology which might allow some armed robots to be controlled mainly by other robots  the us navy has funded a report which indicates that  as military robots become more complex  there should be greater attention to implications of their ability to make autonomous decisions  one researcher states that autonomous robots might be more humane  as they could make decisions more effectively  however  other experts question this  one robot in particular  the eatr  has generated public concerns over its fuel source  as it can continually refuel itself using organic substances  although the engine for the eatr is designed to run on biomass and vegetation specifically selected by its sensors  which it can find on battlefields or other local environments  the project has stated that chicken fat can also be used  manuel de landa has noted that  smart missiles  and autonomous bombs equipped with artificial perception can be considered robots  as they make some of their decisions autonomously  he believes this represents an important and dangerous trend in which humans are handing over important decisions to machines 

for centuries  people have predicted that machines would make workers obsolete and increase unemployment  although the causes of unemployment are usually thought to be due to social policy  a recent example of human replacement involves taiwanese technology company foxconn who  in july 2011  announced a three year plan to replace workers with more robots  at present the company uses ten thousand robots but will increase them to a million robots over a three year period  lawyers have speculated that an increased prevalence of robots in the workplace could lead to the need to improve redundancy laws  kevin j  delaney said  robots are taking human jobs  but bill gates believes that governments should tax companies’ use of them  as a way to at least temporarily slow the spread of automation and to fund other types of employment   the robot tax would also help pay a guaranteed living wage to the displaced workers 

at present  there are two main types of robots  based on their use  general purpose autonomous robots and dedicated robots  robots can be classified by their specificity of purpose  a robot might be designed to perform one particular task extremely well  or a range of tasks less well  all robots by their nature can be re programmed to behave differently  but some are limited by their physical form  for example  a factory robot arm can perform jobs such as cutting  welding  gluing  or acting as a fairground ride  while a pick and place robot can only populate printed circuit boards 

general purpose autonomous robots can perform a variety of functions independently  general purpose autonomous robots typically can navigate independently in known spaces  handle their own re charging needs  interface with electronic doors and elevators and perform other basic tasks  like computers  general purpose robots can link with networks  software and accessories that increase their usefulness  they may recognize people or objects  talk  provide companionship  monitor environmental quality  respond to alarms  pick up supplies and perform other useful tasks  general purpose robots may perform a variety of functions simultaneously or they may take on different roles at different times of day  some such robots try to mimic human beings and may even resemble people in appearance  this type of robot is called a humanoid robot  humanoid robots are still in a very limited stage  as no humanoid robot can  as of yet  actually navigate around a room that it has never been in  thus  humanoid robots are really quite limited  despite their intelligent behaviors in their well known environments 



over the last three decades  automobile factories have become dominated by robots  a typical factory contains hundreds of industrial robots working on fully automated production lines  with one robot for every ten human workers  on an automated production line  a vehicle chassis on a conveyor is welded  glued  painted and finally assembled at a sequence of robot stations 

industrial robots are also used extensively for palletizing and packaging of manufactured goods  for example for rapidly taking drink cartons from the end of a conveyor belt and placing them into boxes  or for loading and unloading machining centers 

mass produced printed circuit boards  pcbs  are almost exclusively manufactured by pick and place robots  typically with scara manipulators  which remove tiny electronic components from strips or trays  and place them on to pcbs with great accuracy  such robots can place hundreds of thousands of components per hour  far out performing a human in speed  accuracy  and reliability 

mobile robots  following markers or wires in the floor  or using vision or lasers  are used to transport goods around large facilities  such as warehouses  container ports  or hospitals 

limited to tasks that could be accurately defined and had to be performed the same way every time  very little feedback or intelligence was required  and the robots needed only the most basic  sensors   the limitations of these agvs are that their paths are not easily altered and they cannot alter their paths if obstacles block them  if one agv breaks down  it may stop the entire operation 

developed to deploy triangulation from beacons or bar code grids for scanning on the floor or ceiling  in most factories  triangulation systems tend to require moderate to high maintenance  such as daily cleaning of all beacons or bar codes  also  if a tall pallet or large vehicle blocks beacons or a bar code is marred  agvs may become lost  often such agvs are designed to be used in human free environments 

such as smartloader  speciminder  adam  tug eskorta  and mt 400 with motivity are designed for people friendly workspaces  they navigate by recognizing natural features  3d scanners or other means of sensing the environment in two or three dimensions help to eliminate cumulative errors in dead reckoning calculations of the agv s current position  some agvs can create maps of their environment using scanning lasers with simultaneous localization and mapping  slam  and use those maps to navigate in real time with other path planning and obstacle avoidance algorithms  they are able to operate in complex environments and perform non repetitive and non sequential tasks such as transporting photomasks in a semiconductor lab  specimens in hospitals and goods in warehouses  for dynamic areas  such as warehouses full of pallets  agvs require additional strategies using three dimensional sensors such as time of flight or stereovision cameras 

there are many jobs which humans would rather leave to robots  the job may be boring  such as domestic cleaning  or dangerous  such as exploring inside a volcano  other jobs are physically inaccessible  such as exploring another planet  cleaning the inside of a long pipe  or performing laparoscopic surgery 

almost every unmanned space probe ever launched was a robot  some were launched in the 1960s with very limited abilities  but their ability to fly and land  in the case of luna 9  is an indication of their status as a robot  this includes the voyager probes and the galileo probes  among others 

teleoperated robots  or telerobots  are devices remotely operated from a distance by a human operator rather than following a predetermined sequence of movements  but which has semi autonomous behaviour  they are used when a human cannot be present on site to perform a job because it is dangerous  far away  or inaccessible  the robot may be in another room or another country  or may be on a very different scale to the operator  for instance  a laparoscopic surgery robot allows the surgeon to work inside a human patient on a relatively small scale compared to open surgery  significantly shortening recovery time  they can also be used to avoid exposing workers to the hazardous and tight spaces such as in duct cleaning <      > when disabling a bomb  the operator sends a small robot to disable it  several authors have been using a device called the longpen to sign books remotely  teleoperated robot aircraft  like the predator unmanned aerial vehicle  are increasingly being used by the military  these pilotless drones can search terrain and fire on targets  hundreds of robots such as irobot s packbot and the foster miller talon are being used in iraq and afghanistan by the u s  military to defuse roadside bombs or improvised explosive devices  ieds  in an activity known as explosive ordnance disposal  eod  

robots are used to automate picking fruit on orchards at a cost lower than that of human pickers 

domestic robots are simple robots dedicated to a single task work in home use  they are used in simple but unwanted jobs  such as vacuum cleaning  floor washing  and lawn mowing  an example of a domestic robot is a roomba 

military robots include the swords robot which is currently used in ground based combat  it can use a variety of weapons and there is some discussion of giving it some degree of autonomy in battleground situations  unmanned combat air vehicles  ucavs   which are an upgraded form of uavs  can do a wide variety of missions  including combat  ucavs are being designed such as the bae systems mantis which would have the ability to fly themselves  to pick their own course and target  and to make most decisions on their own  the bae taranis is a ucav built by great britain which can fly across continents without a pilot and has new means to avoid detection  flight trials are expected to begin in 2011  the aaai has studied this topic in depth and its president has commissioned a study to look at this issue  some have suggested a need to build  friendly ai   meaning that the advances which are already occurring with ai should also include an effort to make ai intrinsically friendly and humane  several such measures reportedly already exist  with robot heavy countries such as japan and south korea having begun to pass regulations requiring robots to be equipped with safety systems  and possibly sets of  laws  akin to asimov s three laws of robotics  an official report was issued in 2009 by the japanese government s robot industry policy committee  chinese officials and researchers have issued a report suggesting a set of ethical rules  and a set of new legal guidelines referred to as  robot legal studies   some concern has been expressed over a possible occurrence of robots telling apparent falsehoods 

mining robots are designed to solve a number of problems currently facing the mining industry  including skills shortages  improving productivity from declining ore grades  and achieving environmental targets  due to the hazardous nature of mining  in particular underground mining  the prevalence of autonomous  semi autonomous  and tele operated robots has greatly increased in recent times  a number of vehicle manufacturers provide autonomous trains  trucks and loaders that will load material  transport it on the mine site to its destination  and unload without requiring human intervention  one of the world s largest mining corporations  rio tinto  has recently expanded its autonomous truck fleet to the world s largest  consisting of 150 autonomous komatsu trucks  operating in western australia  similarly  bhp has announced the expansion of its autonomous drill fleet to the world s largest  21 autonomous atlas copco drills  drilling  longwall and rockbreaking machines are now also available as autonomous robots  the atlas copco rig control system can autonomously execute a drilling plan on a drilling rig  moving the rig into position using gps  set up the drill rig and drill down to specified depths  similarly  the transmin rocklogic system can automatically plan a path to position a rockbreaker at a selected destination  these systems greatly enhance the safety and efficiency of mining operations 

robots in healthcare have two main functions  those which assist an individual  such as a sufferer of a disease like multiple sclerosis  and those which aid in the overall systems such as pharmacies and hospitals 

robots used in home automation have developed over time from simple basic robotic assistants  such as the handy 1  through to semi autonomous robots  such as friend which can assist the elderly and disabled with common tasks  the population is aging in many countries  especially japan  meaning that there are increasing numbers of elderly people to care for  but relatively fewer young people to care for them  humans make the best carers  but where they are unavailable  robots are gradually being introduced  friend is a semi autonomous robot designed to support disabled and elderly people in their daily life activities  like preparing and serving a meal  friend make it possible for patients who are paraplegic  have muscle diseases or serious paralysis  due to strokes etc    to perform tasks without help from other people like therapists or nursing staff 

script pro manufactures a robot designed to help pharmacies fill prescriptions that consist of oral solids or medications in pill form  the pharmacist or pharmacy technician enters the prescription information into its information system  the system  upon determining whether or not the drug is in the robot  will send the information to the robot for filling  the robot has 3 different size vials to fill determined by the size of the pill  the robot technician  user  or pharmacist determines the needed size of the vial based on the tablet when the robot is stocked  once the vial is filled it is brought up to a conveyor belt that delivers it to a holder that spins the vial and attaches the patient label  afterwards it is set on another conveyor that delivers the patient s medication vial to a slot labeled with the patient s name on an led read out  the pharmacist or technician then checks the contents of the vial to ensure it s the correct drug for the correct patient and then seals the vials and sends it out front to be picked up  the robot is a very time efficient device that the pharmacy depends on to fill prescriptions  mckesson s robot rx is another healthcare robotics product that helps pharmacies dispense thousands of medications daily with little or no errors  the robot can be ten feet wide and thirty feet long and can hold hundreds of different kinds of medications and thousands of doses  the pharmacy saves many resources like staff members that are otherwise unavailable in a resource scarce industry  it uses an electromechanical head coupled with a pneumatic system to capture each dose and deliver it to its either stocked or dispensed location  the head moves along a single axis while it rotates 180 degrees to pull the medications  during this process it uses barcode technology to verify its pulling the correct drug  it then delivers the drug to a patient specific bin on a conveyor belt  once the bin is filled with all of the drugs that a particular patient needs and that the robot stocks  the bin is then released and returned out on the conveyor belt to a technician waiting to load it into a cart for delivery to the floor 

while most robots today are installed in factories or homes  performing labour or life saving jobs  many new types of robot are being developed in laboratories around the world  much of the research in robotics focuses not on specific industrial tasks  but on investigations into new types of robot  alternative ways to think about or design robots  and new ways to manufacture them  it is expected that these new types of robot will be able to solve real world problems when they are finally realized 

one approach to designing robots is to base them on animals  bionickangaroo was designed and engineered by studying and applying the physiology and methods of locomotion of a kangaroo 

nanorobotics is the emerging technology field of creating machines or robots whose components are at or close to the microscopic scale of a nanometer  10 −9 meters   also known as  nanobots  or  nanites   they would be constructed from molecular machines  so far  researchers have mostly produced only parts of these complex systems  such as bearings  sensors  and synthetic molecular motors  but functioning robots have also been made such as the entrants to the nanobot robocup contest  researchers also hope to be able to create entire robots as small as viruses or bacteria  which could perform tasks on a tiny scale  possible applications include micro surgery  on the level of individual cells   utility fog  manufacturing  weaponry and cleaning  some people have suggested that if there were nanobots which could reproduce  the earth would turn into  grey goo   while others argue that this hypothetical outcome is nonsense 

a few researchers have investigated the possibility of creating robots which can alter their physical form to suit a particular task  like the fictional t 1000  real robots are nowhere near that sophisticated however  and mostly consist of a small number of cube shaped units  which can move relative to their neighbours  algorithms have been designed in case any such robots become a reality 

robots with silicone bodies and flexible actuators  air muscles  electroactive polymers  and ferrofluids  look and feel different from robots with rigid skeletons  and can have different behaviors 

inspired by colonies of insects such as ants and bees  researchers are modeling the behavior of swarms of thousands of tiny robots which together perform a useful task  such as finding something hidden  cleaning  or spying  each robot is quite simple  but the emergent behavior of the swarm is more complex  the whole set of robots can be considered as one single distributed system  in the same way an ant colony can be considered a superorganism  exhibiting swarm intelligence  the largest swarms so far created include the irobot swarm  the sri mobilerobots centibots project and the open source micro robotic project swarm  which are being used to research collective behaviors  swarms are also more resistant to failure  whereas one large robot may fail and ruin a mission  a swarm can continue even if several robots fail  this could make them attractive for space exploration missions  where failure is normally extremely costly 

robotics also has application in the design of virtual reality interfaces  specialized robots are in widespread use in the haptic research community  these robots  called  haptic interfaces   allow touch enabled user interaction with real and virtual environments  robotic forces allow simulating the mechanical properties of  virtual  objects  which users can experience through their sense of touch 



robotic characters  androids  artificial men women  or gynoids  artificial women   and cyborgs  also  bionic men women   or humans with significant mechanical enhancements  have become a staple of science fiction  the first reference in western literature to mechanical servants appears in homer s iliad  in book xviii  hephaestus  god of fire  creates new armor for the hero achilles  assisted by robots  according to the rieu translation   golden maidservants hastened to help their master  they looked like real women and could not only speak and use their limbs but were endowed with intelligence and trained in handwork by the immortal gods   the words  robot  or  android  are not used to describe them  but they are nevertheless mechanical devices human in appearance   the first use of the word robot was in karel čapek s play r u r   rossum s universal robots   written in 1920    writer karel čapek was born in czechoslovakia  czech republic   possibly the most prolific author of the twentieth century was isaac asimov  1920–1992  who published over five hundred books  asimov is probably best remembered for his science fiction stories and especially those about robots  where he placed robots and their interaction with society at the center of many of his works  asimov carefully considered the problem of the ideal set of instructions robots might be given in order to lower the risk to humans  and arrived at his three laws of robotics  a robot may not injure a human being or  through inaction  allow a human being to come to harm  a robot must obey orders given it by human beings  except where such orders would conflict with the first law  and a robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the first or second law  these were introduced in his 1942 short story  runaround   although foreshadowed in a few earlier stories  later  asimov added the zeroth law   a robot may not harm humanity  or  by inaction  allow humanity to come to harm   the rest of the laws are modified sequentially to acknowledge this  according to the oxford english dictionary  the first passage in asimov s short story  liar    1941  that mentions the first law is the earliest recorded use of the word robotics  asimov was not initially aware of this  he assumed the word already existed by analogy with mechanics  hydraulics  and other similar terms denoting branches of applied knowledge 

robots appear in many films  most of the robots in cinema are fictional  two of the most famous are r2 d2 and c 3po from the star wars franchise 

the concept of humanoid sex robots has elicited both public attention and concern  opponents of the concept have stated that the development of sex robots would be morally wrong  they argue that the introduction of such devices would be socially harmful  and demeaning to women and children 

fears and concerns about robots have been repeatedly expressed in a wide range of books and films  a common theme is the development of a master race of conscious and highly intelligent robots  motivated to take over or destroy the human race  frankenstein  1818   often called the first science fiction novel  has become synonymous with the theme of a robot or android advancing beyond its creator  other works with similar themes include the mechanical man  the terminator  runaway  robocop  the replicators in stargate  the cylons in battlestar galactica  the cybermen and daleks in doctor who  the matrix  enthiran and i  robot  some fictional robots are programmed to kill and destroy  others gain superhuman intelligence and abilities by upgrading their own software and hardware  examples of popular media where the robot becomes evil are 2001  a space odyssey  red planet and enthiran  the 2017 game horizon zero dawn explores themes of robotics in warfare  robot ethics  and the ai control problem  as well as the positive or negative impact such technologies could have on the environment  another common theme is the reaction  sometimes called the  uncanny valley   of unease and even revulsion at the sight of robots that mimic humans too closely  more recently  fictional representations of artificially intelligent robots in films such as a i  artificial intelligence and ex machina and the 2016 tv adaptation of westworld have engaged audience sympathy for the robots themselves 













a robot is a machine—especially one programmable by a computer— capable of carrying out a complex series of actions automatically  robots can be guided by an external control device or the control may be embedded within  robots may be constructed to take on human form but most robots are machines designed to perform a task with no regard to how they look  robots can be autonomous or semi autonomous and range from humanoids such as honda s advanced step in innovative mobility  asimo  and tosy s tosy ping pong playing robot  topio  to industrial robots  medical operating robots  patient assist robots  dog therapy robots  collectively programmed swarm robots  uav drones such as general atomics mq 1 predator  and even microscopic nano robots  by mimicking a lifelike appearance or automating movements  a robot may convey a sense of intelligence or thought of its own  autonomous things are expected to proliferate in the coming decade  with home robotics and the autonomous car as some of the main drivers  the branch of technology that deals with the design  construction  operation  and application of robots  as well as computer systems for their control  sensory feedback  and information processing is robotics  these technologies deal with automated machines that can take the place of humans in dangerous environments or manufacturing processes  or resemble humans in appearance  behavior  or cognition  many of today s robots are inspired by nature contributing to the field of bio inspired robotics  these robots have also created a newer branch of robotics  soft robotics  from the time of ancient civilization there have been many accounts of user configurable automated devices and even automata resembling animals and humans  designed primarily as entertainment  as mechanical techniques developed through the industrial age  there appeared more practical applications such as automated machines  remote control and wireless remote control  the term comes from a czech word  robota  meaning  forced labor   the word  robot  was first used to denote a fictional humanoid in a 1920 play r u r  by the czech writer  karel čapek but it was karel s brother josef čapek who was the word s true inventor  electronics evolved into the driving force of development with the advent of the first electronic autonomous robots created by william grey walter in bristol  england in 1948  as well as computer numerical control  cnc  machine tools in the late 1940s by john t  parsons and frank l  stulen  the first commercial  digital and programmable robot was built by george devol in 1954 and was named the unimate  it was sold to general motors in 1961 where it was used to lift pieces of hot metal from die casting machines at the inland fisher guide plant in the west trenton section of ewing township  new jersey  robots have replaced humans in performing repetitive and dangerous tasks which humans prefer not to do  or are unable to do because of size limitations  or which take place in extreme environments such as outer space or the bottom of the sea  there are concerns about the increasing use of robots and their role in society  robots are blamed for rising technological unemployment as they replace workers in increasing numbers of functions  the use of robots in military combat raises ethical concerns  the possibilities of robot autonomy and potential repercussions have been addressed in fiction and may be a realistic concern in the future 

the word robot can refer to both physical robots and virtual software agents  but the latter are usually referred to as bots  there is no consensus on which machines qualify as robots but there is general agreement among experts  and the public  that robots tend to possess some or all of the following abilities and functions  accept electronic programming  process data or physical perceptions electronically  operate autonomously to some degree  move around  operate physical parts of itself or physical processes  sense and manipulate their environment  and exhibit intelligent behavior  especially behavior which mimics humans or other animals  closely related to the concept of a robot is the field of synthetic biology  which studies entities whose nature is more comparable to beings than to machines 

the idea of automata originates in the mythologies of many cultures around the world  engineers and inventors from ancient civilizations  including ancient china  ancient greece  and ptolemaic egypt  attempted to build self operating machines  some resembling animals and humans  early descriptions of automata include the artificial doves of archytas  the artificial birds of mozi and lu ban  a  speaking  automaton by hero of alexandria  a washstand automaton by philo of byzantium  and a human automaton described in the lie zi 

many ancient mythologies  and most modern religions include artificial people  such as the mechanical servants built by the greek god hephaestus  vulcan to the romans   the clay golems of jewish legend and clay giants of norse legend  and galatea  the mythical statue of pygmalion that came to life  since circa 400 bc  myths of crete include talos  a man of bronze who guarded the cretan island of europa from pirates  in ancient greece  the greek engineer ctesibius  c  270 bc   applied a knowledge of pneumatics and hydraulics to produce the first organ and water clocks with moving figures   in the 4th century bc  the greek mathematician archytas of tarentum postulated a mechanical steam operated bird he called  the pigeon   hero of alexandria  10–70 ad   a greek mathematician and inventor  created numerous user configurable automated devices  and described machines powered by air pressure  steam and water  the 11th century lokapannatti tells of how the buddha s relics were protected by mechanical robots  bhuta vahana yanta   from the kingdom of roma visaya  rome   until they were disarmed by king ashoka  in ancient china  the 3rd century text of the lie zi describes an account of humanoid automata  involving a much earlier encounter between chinese emperor king mu of zhou and a mechanical engineer known as yan shi  an  artificer   yan shi proudly presented the king with a life size  human shaped figure of his mechanical  handiwork  made of leather  wood  and artificial organs  there are also accounts of flying automata in the han fei zi and other texts  which attributes the 5th century bc mohist philosopher mozi and his contemporary lu ban with the invention of artificial wooden birds  ma yuan  that could successfully fly  in 1066  the chinese inventor su song built a water clock in the form of a tower which featured mechanical figurines which chimed the hours  the beginning of automata is associated with the invention of early su song s astronomical clock tower featured mechanical figurines that chimed the hours  his mechanism had a programmable drum machine with pegs  cams  that bumped into little levers that operated percussion instruments  the drummer could be made to play different rhythms and different drum patterns by moving the pegs to different locations  samarangana sutradhara  a sanskrit treatise by bhoja  11th century   includes a chapter about the construction of mechanical contrivances  automata   including mechanical bees and birds  fountains shaped like humans and animals  and male and female dolls that refilled oil lamps  danced  played instruments  and re enacted scenes from hindu mythology  in renaissance italy  leonardo da vinci  1452–1519  sketched plans for a humanoid robot around 1495  da vinci s notebooks  rediscovered in the 1950s  contained detailed drawings of a mechanical knight now known as leonardo s robot  able to sit up  wave its arms and move its head and jaw  the design was probably based on anatomical research recorded in his vitruvian man  it is not known whether he attempted to build it in japan  complex animal and human automata were built between the 17th to 19th centuries  with many described in the 18th century karakuri zui  illustrated machinery  1796   one such automaton was the karakuri ningyō  a mechanized puppet  different variations of the karakuri existed  the butai karakuri  which were used in theatre  the zashiki karakuri  which were small and used in homes  and the dashi karakuri which were used in religious festivals  where the puppets were used to perform reenactments of traditional myths and legends  in france  between 1738 and 1739  jacques de vaucanson exhibited several life sized automatons  a flute player  a pipe player and a duck  the mechanical duck could flap its wings  crane its neck  and swallow food from the exhibitor s hand  and it gave the illusion of digesting its food by excreting matter stored in a hidden compartment 

remotely operated vehicles were demonstrated in the late 19th century in the form of several types of remotely controlled torpedoes  the early 1870s saw remotely controlled torpedoes by john ericsson  pneumatic   john louis lay  electric wire guided   and victor von scheliha  electric wire guided   the brennan torpedo  invented by louis brennan in 1877 was powered by two contra rotating propellors that were spun by rapidly pulling out wires from drums wound inside the torpedo  differential speed on the wires connected to the shore station allowed the torpedo to be guided to its target  making it  the world s first practical guided missile   in 1897 the british inventor ernest wilson was granted a patent for a torpedo remotely controlled by  hertzian   radio  waves and in 1898 nikola tesla publicly demonstrated a wireless controlled torpedo that he hoped to sell to the us navy  archibald low  known as the  father of radio guidance systems  for his pioneering work on guided rockets and planes during the first world war  in 1917  he demonstrated a remote controlled aircraft to the royal flying corps and in the same year built the first wire guided rocket 

 robot  was first applied as a term for artificial automata in a 1920 play r u r  by the czech writer  karel čapek  however  josef čapek was named by his brother karel as the true inventor of the term robot  the word  robot  itself was not new  having been in slavic language as robota  forced laborer   a term which classified those peasants obligated to compulsory service under the feudal system widespread in 19th century europe  see  robot patent   čapek s fictional story postulated the technological creation of artificial human bodies without souls  and the old theme of the feudal robota class eloquently fit the imagination of a new class of manufactured  artificial workers 

in 1928  one of the first humanoid robots  eric  was exhibited at the annual exhibition of the model engineers society in london  where it delivered a speech  invented by w  h  richards  the robot s frame consisted of an aluminium body of armour with eleven electromagnets and one motor powered by a twelve volt power source  the robot could move its hands and head and could be controlled through remote control or voice control  both eric and his  brother  george toured the world  westinghouse electric corporation built televox in 1926  it was a cardboard cutout connected to various devices which users could turn on and off  in 1939  the humanoid robot known as elektro was debuted at the 1939 new york world s fair  seven feet tall  2 1 m  and weighing 265 pounds  120 2 kg   it could walk by voice command  speak about 700 words  using a 78 rpm record player   smoke cigarettes  blow up balloons  and move its head and arms  the body consisted of a steel gear  cam and motor skeleton covered by an aluminum skin  in 1928  japan s first robot  gakutensoku  was designed and constructed by biologist makoto nishimura 

the first electronic autonomous robots with complex behaviour were created by william grey walter of the burden neurological institute at bristol  england in 1948 and 1949  he wanted to prove that rich connections between a small number of brain cells could give rise to very complex behaviors – essentially that the secret of how the brain worked lay in how it was wired up  his first robots  named elmer and elsie  were constructed between 1948 and 1949 and were often described as tortoises due to their shape and slow rate of movement  the three wheeled tortoise robots were capable of phototaxis  by which they could find their way to a recharging station when they ran low on battery power  walter stressed the importance of using purely electronics to simulate brain processes at a time when his contemporaries such as alan turing and john von neumann were all turning towards a view of mental processes in terms of digital computation  his work inspired subsequent generations of robotics researchers such as rodney brooks  hans moravec and mark tilden  modern incarnations of walter s turtles may be found in the form of beam robotics  the first digitally operated and programmable robot was invented by george devol in 1954 and was ultimately called the unimate  this ultimately laid the foundations of the modern robotics industry  devol sold the first unimate to general motors in 1960  and it was installed in 1961 in a plant in trenton  new jersey to lift hot pieces of metal from a die casting machine and stack them  devol s patent for the first digitally operated programmable robotic arm represents the foundation of the modern robotics industry  the first palletizing robot was introduced in 1963 by the fuji yusoki kogyo company  in 1973  a robot with six electromechanically driven axes was patented   by kuka robotics in germany  and the programmable universal manipulation arm was invented by victor scheinman in 1976  and the design was sold to unimation  commercial and industrial robots are now in widespread use performing jobs more cheaply or with greater accuracy and reliability than humans  they are also employed for jobs which are too dirty  dangerous or dull to be suitable for humans  robots are widely used in manufacturing  assembly and packing  transport  earth and space exploration  surgery  weaponry  laboratory research  and mass production of consumer and industrial goods 

various techniques have emerged to develop the science of robotics and robots  one method is evolutionary robotics  in which a number of differing robots are submitted to tests  those which perform best are used as a model to create a subsequent  generation  of robots  another method is developmental robotics  which tracks changes and development within a single robot in the areas of problem solving and other functions  another new type of robot is just recently introduced which acts both as a smartphone and robot and is named robohon  as robots become more advanced  eventually there may be a standard computer operating system designed mainly for robots  robot operating system is an open source set of programs being developed at stanford university  the massachusetts institute of technology and the technical university of munich  germany  among others  ros provides ways to program a robot s navigation and limbs regardless of the specific hardware involved  it also provides high level commands for items like image recognition and even opening doors  when ros boots up on a robot s computer  it would obtain data on attributes such as the length and movement of robots  limbs  it would relay this data to higher level algorithms  microsoft is also developing a  windows for robots  system with its robotics developer studio  which has been available since 2007  japan hopes to have full scale commercialization of service robots by 2025  much technological research in japan is led by japanese government agencies  particularly the trade ministry  many future applications of robotics seem obvious to people  even though they are well beyond the capabilities of robots available at the time of the prediction  as early as 1982 people were confident that someday robots would  1  clean parts by removing molding flash 2  spray paint automobiles with absolutely no human presence 3  pack things in boxes—for example  orient and nest chocolate candies in candy boxes 4  make electrical cable harness 5  load trucks with boxes—a packing problem 6  handle soft goods  such as garments and shoes 7  shear sheep 8  prosthesis 9  cook fast food and work in other service industries 10  household robot  generally such predictions are overly optimistic in timescale 

in 2008  caterpillar inc  developed a dump truck which can drive itself without any human operator  many analysts believe that self driving trucks may eventually revolutionize logistics  by 2014  caterpillar had a self driving dump truck which is expected to greatly change the process of mining  in 2015  these caterpillar trucks were actively used in mining operations in australia by the mining company rio tinto coal australia  some analysts believe that within the next few decades  most trucks will be self driving  a literate or  reading robot  named marge has intelligence that comes from software  she can read newspapers  find and correct misspelled words  learn about banks like barclays  and understand that some restaurants are better places to eat than others  baxter is a new robot introduced in 2012 which learns by guidance  a worker could teach baxter how to perform a task by moving its hands in the desired motion and having baxter memorize them  extra dials  buttons  and controls are available on baxter s arm for more precision and features  any regular worker could program baxter and it only takes a matter of minutes  unlike usual industrial robots that take extensive programs and coding in order to be used  this means baxter needs no programming in order to operate  no software engineers are needed  this also means baxter can be taught to perform multiple  more complicated tasks  sawyer was added in 2015 for smaller  more precise tasks 

the word robot was introduced to the public by the czech interwar writer karel čapek in his play   r u r   rossum s universal robots     published in 1920  the play begins in a factory that uses a chemical substitute for protoplasm to manufacture living  simplified people called robots  the play does not focus in detail on the technology behind the creation of these living creatures  but in their appearance they prefigure modern ideas of androids  creatures who can be mistaken for humans  these mass produced workers are depicted as efficient but emotionless  incapable of original thinking and indifferent to self preservation  at issue is whether the robots are being exploited and the consequences of human dependence upon commodified labor  especially after a number of specially formulated robots achieve self awareness and incite robots all around the world to rise up against the humans   karel čapek himself did not coin the word  he wrote a short letter in reference to an etymology in the oxford english dictionary in which he named his brother  the painter and writer josef čapek  as its actual originator  in an article in the czech journal lidové noviny in 1933  he explained that he had originally wanted to call the creatures laboři   workers   from latin labor   however  he did not like the word  and sought advice from his brother josef  who suggested  roboti   the word robota means literally  corvée    serf labor   and figuratively  drudgery  or  hard work  in czech and also  more general   work    labor  in many slavic languages  e g   bulgarian  russian  serbian  slovak  polish  macedonian  ukrainian  archaic czech  as well as robot in hungarian   traditionally the robota  hungarian robot  was the work period a serf  corvée  had to give for his lord  typically 6 months of the year  the origin of the word is the old church slavonic  old bulgarian  rabota  servitude    work  in contemporary bulgarian and russian   which in turn comes from the proto indo european root  orbh   robot is cognate with the german root arbeit  work   the word robotics  used to describe this field of study  was coined by the science fiction writer isaac asimov  asimov created the  three laws of robotics  which are a recurring theme in his books  these have since been used by many others to define laws used in fiction   the three laws are pure fiction  and no technology yet created has the ability to understand or follow them  and in fact most robots serve military purposes  which run quite contrary to the first law and often the third law   people think about asimov s laws  but they were set up to point out how a simple ethical system doesn t work  if you read the short stories  every single one is about a failure  and they are totally impractical   said dr  joanna bryson of the university of bath   



mobile robots have the capability to move around in their environment and are not fixed to one physical location  an example of a mobile robot that is in common use today is the automated guided vehicle or automatic guided vehicle  agv   an agv is a mobile robot that follows markers or wires in the floor  or uses vision or lasers  agvs are discussed later in this article  mobile robots are also found in industry  military and security environments  they also appear as consumer products  for entertainment or to perform certain tasks like vacuum cleaning  mobile robots are the focus of a great deal of current research and almost every major university has one or more labs that focus on mobile robot research  mobile robots are usually used in tightly controlled environments such as on assembly lines because they have difficulty responding to unexpected interference  because of this most humans rarely encounter robots  however domestic robots for cleaning and maintenance are increasingly common in and around homes in developed countries  robots can also be found in military applications 

industrial robots usually consist of a jointed arm  multi linked manipulator  and an end effector that is attached to a fixed surface  one of the most common type of end effector is a gripper assembly  the international organization for standardization gives a definition of a manipulating industrial robot in iso 8373   an automatically controlled  reprogrammable  multipurpose  manipulator programmable in three or more axes  which may be either fixed in place or mobile for use in industrial automation applications   this definition is used by the international federation of robotics  the european robotics research network  euron  and many national standards committees  <  see talk page as riofa is in disute  the robotics institute of america  ria  uses a broader definition  a robot is a  re programmable multi functional manipulator designed to move materials  parts  tools  or specialized devices through variable programmed motions for the performance of a variety of tasks   the ria subdivides robots into four classes  devices that manipulate objects with manual control  automated devices that manipulate objects with predetermined cycles  programmable and servo controlled robots with continuous point to point trajectories  and robots of this last type which also acquire information from the environment and move intelligently in response    >

most commonly industrial robots are fixed robotic arms and manipulators used primarily for production and distribution of goods  the term  service robot  is less well defined  the international federation of robotics has proposed a tentative definition   a service robot is a robot which operates semi  or fully autonomously to perform services useful to the well being of humans and equipment  excluding manufacturing operations  

robots are used as educational assistants to teachers  from the 1980s  robots such as turtles were used in schools and programmed using the logo language  there are robot kits like lego mindstorms  bioloid  ollo from robotis  or botbrain educational robots can help children to learn about mathematics  physics  programming  and electronics  robotics have also been introduced into the lives of elementary and high school students in the form of robot competitions with the company first  for inspiration and recognition of science and technology   the organization is the foundation for the first robotics competition  first lego league  junior first lego league  and first tech challenge competitions  there have also been devices shaped like robots such as the teaching computer  leachim  1974   and 2 xl  1976   a robot shaped game   teaching toy based on an 8 track tape player  both invented michael j  freeman 

modular robots are a new breed of robots that are designed to increase the utilization of robots by modularizing their architecture  the functionality and effectiveness of a modular robot is easier to increase compared to conventional robots  these robots are composed of a single type of identical  several different identical module types  or similarly shaped modules  which vary in size  their architectural structure allows hyper redundancy for modular robots  as they can be designed with more than 8 degrees of freedom  dof   creating the programming  inverse kinematics and dynamics for modular robots is more complex than with traditional robots  modular robots may be composed of l shaped modules  cubic modules  and u and h shaped modules  anat technology  an early modular robotic technology patented by robotics design inc   allows the creation of modular robots from u and h shaped modules that connect in a chain  and are used to form heterogeneous and homogenous modular robot systems  these  anat robots  can be designed with  n  dof as each module is a complete motorized robotic system that folds relatively to the modules connected before and after it in its chain  and therefore a single module allows one degree of freedom  the more modules that are connected to one another  the more degrees of freedom it will have  l shaped modules can also be designed in a chain  and must become increasingly smaller as the size of the chain increases  as payloads attached to the end of the chain place a greater strain on modules that are further from the base  anat h shaped modules do not suffer from this problem  as their design allows a modular robot to distribute pressure and impacts evenly amongst other attached modules  and therefore payload carrying capacity does not decrease as the length of the arm increases  modular robots can be manually or self reconfigured to form a different robot  that may perform different applications  because modular robots of the same architecture type are composed of modules that compose different modular robots  a snake arm robot can combine with another to form a dual or quadra arm robot  or can split into several mobile robots  and mobile robots can split into multiple smaller ones  or combine with others into a larger or different one  this allows a single modular robot the ability to be fully specialized in a single task  as well as the capacity to be specialized to perform multiple different tasks  modular robotic technology is currently being applied in hybrid transportation  industrial automation  duct cleaning and handling  many research centres and universities have also studied this technology  and have developed prototypes 

a collaborative robot or cobot is a robot that can safely and effectively interact with human workers while performing simple industrial tasks  however  end effectors and other environmental conditions may create hazards  and as such risk assessments should be done before using any industrial motion control application  the collaborative robots most widely used in industries today are manufactured by universal robots in denmark  rethink robotics—founded by rodney brooks  previously with irobot—introduced baxter in september 2012  as an industrial robot designed to safely interact with neighboring human workers  and be programmable for performing simple tasks  baxters stop if they detect a human in the way of their robotic arms and have prominent off switches  intended for sale to small businesses  they are promoted as the robotic analogue of the personal computer    190 companies in the us have bought baxters and they are being used commercially in the uk 

roughly half of all the robots in the world are in asia  32  in europe  and 16  in north america  1  in australasia and 1  in africa  40  of all the robots in the world are in japan  making japan the country with the highest number of robots 

as robots have become more advanced and sophisticated  experts and academics have increasingly explored the questions of what ethics might govern robots  behavior  and whether robots might be able to claim any kind of social  cultural  ethical or legal rights  one scientific team has said that it is possible that a robot brain will exist by 2019  others predict robot intelligence breakthroughs by 2050  recent advances have made robotic behavior more sophisticated  the social impact of intelligent robots is subject of a 2010 documentary film called plug   pray  vernor vinge has suggested that a moment may come when computers and robots are smarter than humans  he calls this  the singularity   he suggests that it may be somewhat or possibly very dangerous for humans  this is discussed by a philosophy called singularitarianism  in 2009  experts attended a conference hosted by the association for the advancement of artificial intelligence  aaai  to discuss whether computers and robots might be able to acquire any autonomy  and how much these abilities might pose a threat or hazard  they noted that some robots have acquired various forms of semi autonomy  including being able to find power sources on their own and being able to independently choose targets to attack with weapons  they also noted that some computer viruses can evade elimination and have achieved  cockroach intelligence   they noted that self awareness as depicted in science fiction is probably unlikely  but that there were other potential hazards and pitfalls  various media sources and scientific groups have noted separate trends in differing areas which might together result in greater robotic functionalities and autonomy  and which pose some inherent concerns  in 2015  the nao alderen robots were shown to have a capability for a degree of self awareness  researchers at the rensselaer polytechnic institute ai and reasoning lab in new york conducted an experiment where a robot became aware of itself  and corrected its answer to a question once it had realised this 

some experts and academics have questioned the use of robots for military combat  especially when such robots are given some degree of autonomous functions  there are also concerns about technology which might allow some armed robots to be controlled mainly by other robots  the us navy has funded a report which indicates that  as military robots become more complex  there should be greater attention to implications of their ability to make autonomous decisions  one researcher states that autonomous robots might be more humane  as they could make decisions more effectively  however  other experts question this  one robot in particular  the eatr  has generated public concerns over its fuel source  as it can continually refuel itself using organic substances  although the engine for the eatr is designed to run on biomass and vegetation specifically selected by its sensors  which it can find on battlefields or other local environments  the project has stated that chicken fat can also be used  manuel de landa has noted that  smart missiles  and autonomous bombs equipped with artificial perception can be considered robots  as they make some of their decisions autonomously  he believes this represents an important and dangerous trend in which humans are handing over important decisions to machines 

for centuries  people have predicted that machines would make workers obsolete and increase unemployment  although the causes of unemployment are usually thought to be due to social policy  a recent example of human replacement involves taiwanese technology company foxconn who  in july 2011  announced a three year plan to replace workers with more robots  at present the company uses ten thousand robots but will increase them to a million robots over a three year period  lawyers have speculated that an increased prevalence of robots in the workplace could lead to the need to improve redundancy laws  kevin j  delaney said  robots are taking human jobs  but bill gates believes that governments should tax companies’ use of them  as a way to at least temporarily slow the spread of automation and to fund other types of employment   the robot tax would also help pay a guaranteed living wage to the displaced workers 

at present  there are two main types of robots  based on their use  general purpose autonomous robots and dedicated robots  robots can be classified by their specificity of purpose  a robot might be designed to perform one particular task extremely well  or a range of tasks less well  all robots by their nature can be re programmed to behave differently  but some are limited by their physical form  for example  a factory robot arm can perform jobs such as cutting  welding  gluing  or acting as a fairground ride  while a pick and place robot can only populate printed circuit boards 

general purpose autonomous robots can perform a variety of functions independently  general purpose autonomous robots typically can navigate independently in known spaces  handle their own re charging needs  interface with electronic doors and elevators and perform other basic tasks  like computers  general purpose robots can link with networks  software and accessories that increase their usefulness  they may recognize people or objects  talk  provide companionship  monitor environmental quality  respond to alarms  pick up supplies and perform other useful tasks  general purpose robots may perform a variety of functions simultaneously or they may take on different roles at different times of day  some such robots try to mimic human beings and may even resemble people in appearance  this type of robot is called a humanoid robot  humanoid robots are still in a very limited stage  as no humanoid robot can  as of yet  actually navigate around a room that it has never been in  thus  humanoid robots are really quite limited  despite their intelligent behaviors in their well known environments 



over the last three decades  automobile factories have become dominated by robots  a typical factory contains hundreds of industrial robots working on fully automated production lines  with one robot for every ten human workers  on an automated production line  a vehicle chassis on a conveyor is welded  glued  painted and finally assembled at a sequence of robot stations 

industrial robots are also used extensively for palletizing and packaging of manufactured goods  for example for rapidly taking drink cartons from the end of a conveyor belt and placing them into boxes  or for loading and unloading machining centers 

mass produced printed circuit boards  pcbs  are almost exclusively manufactured by pick and place robots  typically with scara manipulators  which remove tiny electronic components from strips or trays  and place them on to pcbs with great accuracy  such robots can place hundreds of thousands of components per hour  far out performing a human in speed  accuracy  and reliability 

mobile robots  following markers or wires in the floor  or using vision or lasers  are used to transport goods around large facilities  such as warehouses  container ports  or hospitals 

limited to tasks that could be accurately defined and had to be performed the same way every time  very little feedback or intelligence was required  and the robots needed only the most basic  sensors   the limitations of these agvs are that their paths are not easily altered and they cannot alter their paths if obstacles block them  if one agv breaks down  it may stop the entire operation 

developed to deploy triangulation from beacons or bar code grids for scanning on the floor or ceiling  in most factories  triangulation systems tend to require moderate to high maintenance  such as daily cleaning of all beacons or bar codes  also  if a tall pallet or large vehicle blocks beacons or a bar code is marred  agvs may become lost  often such agvs are designed to be used in human free environments 

such as smartloader  speciminder  adam  tug eskorta  and mt 400 with motivity are designed for people friendly workspaces  they navigate by recognizing natural features  3d scanners or other means of sensing the environment in two or three dimensions help to eliminate cumulative errors in dead reckoning calculations of the agv s current position  some agvs can create maps of their environment using scanning lasers with simultaneous localization and mapping  slam  and use those maps to navigate in real time with other path planning and obstacle avoidance algorithms  they are able to operate in complex environments and perform non repetitive and non sequential tasks such as transporting photomasks in a semiconductor lab  specimens in hospitals and goods in warehouses  for dynamic areas  such as warehouses full of pallets  agvs require additional strategies using three dimensional sensors such as time of flight or stereovision cameras 

there are many jobs which humans would rather leave to robots  the job may be boring  such as domestic cleaning  or dangerous  such as exploring inside a volcano  other jobs are physically inaccessible  such as exploring another planet  cleaning the inside of a long pipe  or performing laparoscopic surgery 

almost every unmanned space probe ever launched was a robot  some were launched in the 1960s with very limited abilities  but their ability to fly and land  in the case of luna 9  is an indication of their status as a robot  this includes the voyager probes and the galileo probes  among others 

teleoperated robots  or telerobots  are devices remotely operated from a distance by a human operator rather than following a predetermined sequence of movements  but which has semi autonomous behaviour  they are used when a human cannot be present on site to perform a job because it is dangerous  far away  or inaccessible  the robot may be in another room or another country  or may be on a very different scale to the operator  for instance  a laparoscopic surgery robot allows the surgeon to work inside a human patient on a relatively small scale compared to open surgery  significantly shortening recovery time  they can also be used to avoid exposing workers to the hazardous and tight spaces such as in duct cleaning <      > when disabling a bomb  the operator sends a small robot to disable it  several authors have been using a device called the longpen to sign books remotely  teleoperated robot aircraft  like the predator unmanned aerial vehicle  are increasingly being used by the military  these pilotless drones can search terrain and fire on targets  hundreds of robots such as irobot s packbot and the foster miller talon are being used in iraq and afghanistan by the u s  military to defuse roadside bombs or improvised explosive devices  ieds  in an activity known as explosive ordnance disposal  eod  

robots are used to automate picking fruit on orchards at a cost lower than that of human pickers 

domestic robots are simple robots dedicated to a single task work in home use  they are used in simple but unwanted jobs  such as vacuum cleaning  floor washing  and lawn mowing  an example of a domestic robot is a roomba 

military robots include the swords robot which is currently used in ground based combat  it can use a variety of weapons and there is some discussion of giving it some degree of autonomy in battleground situations  unmanned combat air vehicles  ucavs   which are an upgraded form of uavs  can do a wide variety of missions  including combat  ucavs are being designed such as the bae systems mantis which would have the ability to fly themselves  to pick their own course and target  and to make most decisions on their own  the bae taranis is a ucav built by great britain which can fly across continents without a pilot and has new means to avoid detection  flight trials are expected to begin in 2011  the aaai has studied this topic in depth and its president has commissioned a study to look at this issue  some have suggested a need to build  friendly ai   meaning that the advances which are already occurring with ai should also include an effort to make ai intrinsically friendly and humane  several such measures reportedly already exist  with robot heavy countries such as japan and south korea having begun to pass regulations requiring robots to be equipped with safety systems  and possibly sets of  laws  akin to asimov s three laws of robotics  an official report was issued in 2009 by the japanese government s robot industry policy committee  chinese officials and researchers have issued a report suggesting a set of ethical rules  and a set of new legal guidelines referred to as  robot legal studies   some concern has been expressed over a possible occurrence of robots telling apparent falsehoods 

mining robots are designed to solve a number of problems currently facing the mining industry  including skills shortages  improving productivity from declining ore grades  and achieving environmental targets  due to the hazardous nature of mining  in particular underground mining  the prevalence of autonomous  semi autonomous  and tele operated robots has greatly increased in recent times  a number of vehicle manufacturers provide autonomous trains  trucks and loaders that will load material  transport it on the mine site to its destination  and unload without requiring human intervention  one of the world s largest mining corporations  rio tinto  has recently expanded its autonomous truck fleet to the world s largest  consisting of 150 autonomous komatsu trucks  operating in western australia  similarly  bhp has announced the expansion of its autonomous drill fleet to the world s largest  21 autonomous atlas copco drills  drilling  longwall and rockbreaking machines are now also available as autonomous robots  the atlas copco rig control system can autonomously execute a drilling plan on a drilling rig  moving the rig into position using gps  set up the drill rig and drill down to specified depths  similarly  the transmin rocklogic system can automatically plan a path to position a rockbreaker at a selected destination  these systems greatly enhance the safety and efficiency of mining operations 

robots in healthcare have two main functions  those which assist an individual  such as a sufferer of a disease like multiple sclerosis  and those which aid in the overall systems such as pharmacies and hospitals 

robots used in home automation have developed over time from simple basic robotic assistants  such as the handy 1  through to semi autonomous robots  such as friend which can assist the elderly and disabled with common tasks  the population is aging in many countries  especially japan  meaning that there are increasing numbers of elderly people to care for  but relatively fewer young people to care for them  humans make the best carers  but where they are unavailable  robots are gradually being introduced  friend is a semi autonomous robot designed to support disabled and elderly people in their daily life activities  like preparing and serving a meal  friend make it possible for patients who are paraplegic  have muscle diseases or serious paralysis  due to strokes etc    to perform tasks without help from other people like therapists or nursing staff 

script pro manufactures a robot designed to help pharmacies fill prescriptions that consist of oral solids or medications in pill form  the pharmacist or pharmacy technician enters the prescription information into its information system  the system  upon determining whether or not the drug is in the robot  will send the information to the robot for filling  the robot has 3 different size vials to fill determined by the size of the pill  the robot technician  user  or pharmacist determines the needed size of the vial based on the tablet when the robot is stocked  once the vial is filled it is brought up to a conveyor belt that delivers it to a holder that spins the vial and attaches the patient label  afterwards it is set on another conveyor that delivers the patient s medication vial to a slot labeled with the patient s name on an led read out  the pharmacist or technician then checks the contents of the vial to ensure it s the correct drug for the correct patient and then seals the vials and sends it out front to be picked up  the robot is a very time efficient device that the pharmacy depends on to fill prescriptions  mckesson s robot rx is another healthcare robotics product that helps pharmacies dispense thousands of medications daily with little or no errors  the robot can be ten feet wide and thirty feet long and can hold hundreds of different kinds of medications and thousands of doses  the pharmacy saves many resources like staff members that are otherwise unavailable in a resource scarce industry  it uses an electromechanical head coupled with a pneumatic system to capture each dose and deliver it to its either stocked or dispensed location  the head moves along a single axis while it rotates 180 degrees to pull the medications  during this process it uses barcode technology to verify its pulling the correct drug  it then delivers the drug to a patient specific bin on a conveyor belt  once the bin is filled with all of the drugs that a particular patient needs and that the robot stocks  the bin is then released and returned out on the conveyor belt to a technician waiting to load it into a cart for delivery to the floor 

while most robots today are installed in factories or homes  performing labour or life saving jobs  many new types of robot are being developed in laboratories around the world  much of the research in robotics focuses not on specific industrial tasks  but on investigations into new types of robot  alternative ways to think about or design robots  and new ways to manufacture them  it is expected that these new types of robot will be able to solve real world problems when they are finally realized 

one approach to designing robots is to base them on animals  bionickangaroo was designed and engineered by studying and applying the physiology and methods of locomotion of a kangaroo 

nanorobotics is the emerging technology field of creating machines or robots whose components are at or close to the microscopic scale of a nanometer  10 −9 meters   also known as  nanobots  or  nanites   they would be constructed from molecular machines  so far  researchers have mostly produced only parts of these complex systems  such as bearings  sensors  and synthetic molecular motors  but functioning robots have also been made such as the entrants to the nanobot robocup contest  researchers also hope to be able to create entire robots as small as viruses or bacteria  which could perform tasks on a tiny scale  possible applications include micro surgery  on the level of individual cells   utility fog  manufacturing  weaponry and cleaning  some people have suggested that if there were nanobots which could reproduce  the earth would turn into  grey goo   while others argue that this hypothetical outcome is nonsense 

a few researchers have investigated the possibility of creating robots which can alter their physical form to suit a particular task  like the fictional t 1000  real robots are nowhere near that sophisticated however  and mostly consist of a small number of cube shaped units  which can move relative to their neighbours  algorithms have been designed in case any such robots become a reality 

robots with silicone bodies and flexible actuators  air muscles  electroactive polymers  and ferrofluids  look and feel different from robots with rigid skeletons  and can have different behaviors 

inspired by colonies of insects such as ants and bees  researchers are modeling the behavior of swarms of thousands of tiny robots which together perform a useful task  such as finding something hidden  cleaning  or spying  each robot is quite simple  but the emergent behavior of the swarm is more complex  the whole set of robots can be considered as one single distributed system  in the same way an ant colony can be considered a superorganism  exhibiting swarm intelligence  the largest swarms so far created include the irobot swarm  the sri mobilerobots centibots project and the open source micro robotic project swarm  which are being used to research collective behaviors  swarms are also more resistant to failure  whereas one large robot may fail and ruin a mission  a swarm can continue even if several robots fail  this could make them attractive for space exploration missions  where failure is normally extremely costly 

robotics also has application in the design of virtual reality interfaces  specialized robots are in widespread use in the haptic research community  these robots  called  haptic interfaces   allow touch enabled user interaction with real and virtual environments  robotic forces allow simulating the mechanical properties of  virtual  objects  which users can experience through their sense of touch 



robotic characters  androids  artificial men women  or gynoids  artificial women   and cyborgs  also  bionic men women   or humans with significant mechanical enhancements  have become a staple of science fiction  the first reference in western literature to mechanical servants appears in homer s iliad  in book xviii  hephaestus  god of fire  creates new armor for the hero achilles  assisted by robots  according to the rieu translation   golden maidservants hastened to help their master  they looked like real women and could not only speak and use their limbs but were endowed with intelligence and trained in handwork by the immortal gods   the words  robot  or  android  are not used to describe them  but they are nevertheless mechanical devices human in appearance   the first use of the word robot was in karel čapek s play r u r   rossum s universal robots   written in 1920    writer karel čapek was born in czechoslovakia  czech republic   possibly the most prolific author of the twentieth century was isaac asimov  1920–1992  who published over five hundred books  asimov is probably best remembered for his science fiction stories and especially those about robots  where he placed robots and their interaction with society at the center of many of his works  asimov carefully considered the problem of the ideal set of instructions robots might be given in order to lower the risk to humans  and arrived at his three laws of robotics  a robot may not injure a human being or  through inaction  allow a human being to come to harm  a robot must obey orders given it by human beings  except where such orders would conflict with the first law  and a robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the first or second law  these were introduced in his 1942 short story  runaround   although foreshadowed in a few earlier stories  later  asimov added the zeroth law   a robot may not harm humanity  or  by inaction  allow humanity to come to harm   the rest of the laws are modified sequentially to acknowledge this  according to the oxford english dictionary  the first passage in asimov s short story  liar    1941  that mentions the first law is the earliest recorded use of the word robotics  asimov was not initially aware of this  he assumed the word already existed by analogy with mechanics  hydraulics  and other similar terms denoting branches of applied knowledge 

robots appear in many films  most of the robots in cinema are fictional  two of the most famous are r2 d2 and c 3po from the star wars franchise 

the concept of humanoid sex robots has elicited both public attention and concern  opponents of the concept have stated that the development of sex robots would be morally wrong  they argue that the introduction of such devices would be socially harmful  and demeaning to women and children 

fears and concerns about robots have been repeatedly expressed in a wide range of books and films  a common theme is the development of a master race of conscious and highly intelligent robots  motivated to take over or destroy the human race  frankenstein  1818   often called the first science fiction novel  has become synonymous with the theme of a robot or android advancing beyond its creator  other works with similar themes include the mechanical man  the terminator  runaway  robocop  the replicators in stargate  the cylons in battlestar galactica  the cybermen and daleks in doctor who  the matrix  enthiran and i  robot  some fictional robots are programmed to kill and destroy  others gain superhuman intelligence and abilities by upgrading their own software and hardware  examples of popular media where the robot becomes evil are 2001  a space odyssey  red planet and enthiran  the 2017 game horizon zero dawn explores themes of robotics in warfare  robot ethics  and the ai control problem  as well as the positive or negative impact such technologies could have on the environment  another common theme is the reaction  sometimes called the  uncanny valley   of unease and even revulsion at the sight of robots that mimic humans too closely  more recently  fictional representations of artificially intelligent robots in films such as a i  artificial intelligence and ex machina and the 2016 tv adaptation of westworld have engaged audience sympathy for the robots themselves 













a robot is a machine—especially one programmable by a computer— capable of carrying out a complex series of actions automatically  robots can be guided by an external control device or the control may be embedded within  robots may be constructed to take on human form but most robots are machines designed to perform a task with no regard to how they look  robots can be autonomous or semi autonomous and range from humanoids such as honda s advanced step in innovative mobility  asimo  and tosy s tosy ping pong playing robot  topio  to industrial robots  medical operating robots  patient assist robots  dog therapy robots  collectively programmed swarm robots  uav drones such as general atomics mq 1 predator  and even microscopic nano robots  by mimicking a lifelike appearance or automating movements  a robot may convey a sense of intelligence or thought of its own  autonomous things are expected to proliferate in the coming decade  with home robotics and the autonomous car as some of the main drivers  the branch of technology that deals with the design  construction  operation  and application of robots  as well as computer systems for their control  sensory feedback  and information processing is robotics  these technologies deal with automated machines that can take the place of humans in dangerous environments or manufacturing processes  or resemble humans in appearance  behavior  or cognition  many of today s robots are inspired by nature contributing to the field of bio inspired robotics  these robots have also created a newer branch of robotics  soft robotics  from the time of ancient civilization there have been many accounts of user configurable automated devices and even automata resembling animals and humans  designed primarily as entertainment  as mechanical techniques developed through the industrial age  there appeared more practical applications such as automated machines  remote control and wireless remote control  the term comes from a czech word  robota  meaning  forced labor   the word  robot  was first used to denote a fictional humanoid in a 1920 play r u r  by the czech writer  karel čapek but it was karel s brother josef čapek who was the word s true inventor  electronics evolved into the driving force of development with the advent of the first electronic autonomous robots created by william grey walter in bristol  england in 1948  as well as computer numerical control  cnc  machine tools in the late 1940s by john t  parsons and frank l  stulen  the first commercial  digital and programmable robot was built by george devol in 1954 and was named the unimate  it was sold to general motors in 1961 where it was used to lift pieces of hot metal from die casting machines at the inland fisher guide plant in the west trenton section of ewing township  new jersey  robots have replaced humans in performing repetitive and dangerous tasks which humans prefer not to do  or are unable to do because of size limitations  or which take place in extreme environments such as outer space or the bottom of the sea  there are concerns about the increasing use of robots and their role in society  robots are blamed for rising technological unemployment as they replace workers in increasing numbers of functions  the use of robots in military combat raises ethical concerns  the possibilities of robot autonomy and potential repercussions have been addressed in fiction and may be a realistic concern in the future 

the word robot can refer to both physical robots and virtual software agents  but the latter are usually referred to as bots  there is no consensus on which machines qualify as robots but there is general agreement among experts  and the public  that robots tend to possess some or all of the following abilities and functions  accept electronic programming  process data or physical perceptions electronically  operate autonomously to some degree  move around  operate physical parts of itself or physical processes  sense and manipulate their environment  and exhibit intelligent behavior  especially behavior which mimics humans or other animals  closely related to the concept of a robot is the field of synthetic biology  which studies entities whose nature is more comparable to beings than to machines 

the idea of automata originates in the mythologies of many cultures around the world  engineers and inventors from ancient civilizations  including ancient china  ancient greece  and ptolemaic egypt  attempted to build self operating machines  some resembling animals and humans  early descriptions of automata include the artificial doves of archytas  the artificial birds of mozi and lu ban  a  speaking  automaton by hero of alexandria  a washstand automaton by philo of byzantium  and a human automaton described in the lie zi 

many ancient mythologies  and most modern religions include artificial people  such as the mechanical servants built by the greek god hephaestus  vulcan to the romans   the clay golems of jewish legend and clay giants of norse legend  and galatea  the mythical statue of pygmalion that came to life  since circa 400 bc  myths of crete include talos  a man of bronze who guarded the cretan island of europa from pirates  in ancient greece  the greek engineer ctesibius  c  270 bc   applied a knowledge of pneumatics and hydraulics to produce the first organ and water clocks with moving figures   in the 4th century bc  the greek mathematician archytas of tarentum postulated a mechanical steam operated bird he called  the pigeon   hero of alexandria  10–70 ad   a greek mathematician and inventor  created numerous user configurable automated devices  and described machines powered by air pressure  steam and water  the 11th century lokapannatti tells of how the buddha s relics were protected by mechanical robots  bhuta vahana yanta   from the kingdom of roma visaya  rome   until they were disarmed by king ashoka  in ancient china  the 3rd century text of the lie zi describes an account of humanoid automata  involving a much earlier encounter between chinese emperor king mu of zhou and a mechanical engineer known as yan shi  an  artificer   yan shi proudly presented the king with a life size  human shaped figure of his mechanical  handiwork  made of leather  wood  and artificial organs  there are also accounts of flying automata in the han fei zi and other texts  which attributes the 5th century bc mohist philosopher mozi and his contemporary lu ban with the invention of artificial wooden birds  ma yuan  that could successfully fly  in 1066  the chinese inventor su song built a water clock in the form of a tower which featured mechanical figurines which chimed the hours  the beginning of automata is associated with the invention of early su song s astronomical clock tower featured mechanical figurines that chimed the hours  his mechanism had a programmable drum machine with pegs  cams  that bumped into little levers that operated percussion instruments  the drummer could be made to play different rhythms and different drum patterns by moving the pegs to different locations  samarangana sutradhara  a sanskrit treatise by bhoja  11th century   includes a chapter about the construction of mechanical contrivances  automata   including mechanical bees and birds  fountains shaped like humans and animals  and male and female dolls that refilled oil lamps  danced  played instruments  and re enacted scenes from hindu mythology  in renaissance italy  leonardo da vinci  1452–1519  sketched plans for a humanoid robot around 1495  da vinci s notebooks  rediscovered in the 1950s  contained detailed drawings of a mechanical knight now known as leonardo s robot  able to sit up  wave its arms and move its head and jaw  the design was probably based on anatomical research recorded in his vitruvian man  it is not known whether he attempted to build it in japan  complex animal and human automata were built between the 17th to 19th centuries  with many described in the 18th century karakuri zui  illustrated machinery  1796   one such automaton was the karakuri ningyō  a mechanized puppet  different variations of the karakuri existed  the butai karakuri  which were used in theatre  the zashiki karakuri  which were small and used in homes  and the dashi karakuri which were used in religious festivals  where the puppets were used to perform reenactments of traditional myths and legends  in france  between 1738 and 1739  jacques de vaucanson exhibited several life sized automatons  a flute player  a pipe player and a duck  the mechanical duck could flap its wings  crane its neck  and swallow food from the exhibitor s hand  and it gave the illusion of digesting its food by excreting matter stored in a hidden compartment 

remotely operated vehicles were demonstrated in the late 19th century in the form of several types of remotely controlled torpedoes  the early 1870s saw remotely controlled torpedoes by john ericsson  pneumatic   john louis lay  electric wire guided   and victor von scheliha  electric wire guided   the brennan torpedo  invented by louis brennan in 1877 was powered by two contra rotating propellors that were spun by rapidly pulling out wires from drums wound inside the torpedo  differential speed on the wires connected to the shore station allowed the torpedo to be guided to its target  making it  the world s first practical guided missile   in 1897 the british inventor ernest wilson was granted a patent for a torpedo remotely controlled by  hertzian   radio  waves and in 1898 nikola tesla publicly demonstrated a wireless controlled torpedo that he hoped to sell to the us navy  archibald low  known as the  father of radio guidance systems  for his pioneering work on guided rockets and planes during the first world war  in 1917  he demonstrated a remote controlled aircraft to the royal flying corps and in the same year built the first wire guided rocket 

 robot  was first applied as a term for artificial automata in a 1920 play r u r  by the czech writer  karel čapek  however  josef čapek was named by his brother karel as the true inventor of the term robot  the word  robot  itself was not new  having been in slavic language as robota  forced laborer   a term which classified those peasants obligated to compulsory service under the feudal system widespread in 19th century europe  see  robot patent   čapek s fictional story postulated the technological creation of artificial human bodies without souls  and the old theme of the feudal robota class eloquently fit the imagination of a new class of manufactured  artificial workers 

in 1928  one of the first humanoid robots  eric  was exhibited at the annual exhibition of the model engineers society in london  where it delivered a speech  invented by w  h  richards  the robot s frame consisted of an aluminium body of armour with eleven electromagnets and one motor powered by a twelve volt power source  the robot could move its hands and head and could be controlled through remote control or voice control  both eric and his  brother  george toured the world  westinghouse electric corporation built televox in 1926  it was a cardboard cutout connected to various devices which users could turn on and off  in 1939  the humanoid robot known as elektro was debuted at the 1939 new york world s fair  seven feet tall  2 1 m  and weighing 265 pounds  120 2 kg   it could walk by voice command  speak about 700 words  using a 78 rpm record player   smoke cigarettes  blow up balloons  and move its head and arms  the body consisted of a steel gear  cam and motor skeleton covered by an aluminum skin  in 1928  japan s first robot  gakutensoku  was designed and constructed by biologist makoto nishimura 

the first electronic autonomous robots with complex behaviour were created by william grey walter of the burden neurological institute at bristol  england in 1948 and 1949  he wanted to prove that rich connections between a small number of brain cells could give rise to very complex behaviors – essentially that the secret of how the brain worked lay in how it was wired up  his first robots  named elmer and elsie  were constructed between 1948 and 1949 and were often described as tortoises due to their shape and slow rate of movement  the three wheeled tortoise robots were capable of phototaxis  by which they could find their way to a recharging station when they ran low on battery power  walter stressed the importance of using purely electronics to simulate brain processes at a time when his contemporaries such as alan turing and john von neumann were all turning towards a view of mental processes in terms of digital computation  his work inspired subsequent generations of robotics researchers such as rodney brooks  hans moravec and mark tilden  modern incarnations of walter s turtles may be found in the form of beam robotics  the first digitally operated and programmable robot was invented by george devol in 1954 and was ultimately called the unimate  this ultimately laid the foundations of the modern robotics industry  devol sold the first unimate to general motors in 1960  and it was installed in 1961 in a plant in trenton  new jersey to lift hot pieces of metal from a die casting machine and stack them  devol s patent for the first digitally operated programmable robotic arm represents the foundation of the modern robotics industry  the first palletizing robot was introduced in 1963 by the fuji yusoki kogyo company  in 1973  a robot with six electromechanically driven axes was patented   by kuka robotics in germany  and the programmable universal manipulation arm was invented by victor scheinman in 1976  and the design was sold to unimation  commercial and industrial robots are now in widespread use performing jobs more cheaply or with greater accuracy and reliability than humans  they are also employed for jobs which are too dirty  dangerous or dull to be suitable for humans  robots are widely used in manufacturing  assembly and packing  transport  earth and space exploration  surgery  weaponry  laboratory research  and mass production of consumer and industrial goods 

various techniques have emerged to develop the science of robotics and robots  one method is evolutionary robotics  in which a number of differing robots are submitted to tests  those which perform best are used as a model to create a subsequent  generation  of robots  another method is developmental robotics  which tracks changes and development within a single robot in the areas of problem solving and other functions  another new type of robot is just recently introduced which acts both as a smartphone and robot and is named robohon  as robots become more advanced  eventually there may be a standard computer operating system designed mainly for robots  robot operating system is an open source set of programs being developed at stanford university  the massachusetts institute of technology and the technical university of munich  germany  among others  ros provides ways to program a robot s navigation and limbs regardless of the specific hardware involved  it also provides high level commands for items like image recognition and even opening doors  when ros boots up on a robot s computer  it would obtain data on attributes such as the length and movement of robots  limbs  it would relay this data to higher level algorithms  microsoft is also developing a  windows for robots  system with its robotics developer studio  which has been available since 2007  japan hopes to have full scale commercialization of service robots by 2025  much technological research in japan is led by japanese government agencies  particularly the trade ministry  many future applications of robotics seem obvious to people  even though they are well beyond the capabilities of robots available at the time of the prediction  as early as 1982 people were confident that someday robots would  1  clean parts by removing molding flash 2  spray paint automobiles with absolutely no human presence 3  pack things in boxes—for example  orient and nest chocolate candies in candy boxes 4  make electrical cable harness 5  load trucks with boxes—a packing problem 6  handle soft goods  such as garments and shoes 7  shear sheep 8  prosthesis 9  cook fast food and work in other service industries 10  household robot  generally such predictions are overly optimistic in timescale 

in 2008  caterpillar inc  developed a dump truck which can drive itself without any human operator  many analysts believe that self driving trucks may eventually revolutionize logistics  by 2014  caterpillar had a self driving dump truck which is expected to greatly change the process of mining  in 2015  these caterpillar trucks were actively used in mining operations in australia by the mining company rio tinto coal australia  some analysts believe that within the next few decades  most trucks will be self driving  a literate or  reading robot  named marge has intelligence that comes from software  she can read newspapers  find and correct misspelled words  learn about banks like barclays  and understand that some restaurants are better places to eat than others  baxter is a new robot introduced in 2012 which learns by guidance  a worker could teach baxter how to perform a task by moving its hands in the desired motion and having baxter memorize them  extra dials  buttons  and controls are available on baxter s arm for more precision and features  any regular worker could program baxter and it only takes a matter of minutes  unlike usual industrial robots that take extensive programs and coding in order to be used  this means baxter needs no programming in order to operate  no software engineers are needed  this also means baxter can be taught to perform multiple  more complicated tasks  sawyer was added in 2015 for smaller  more precise tasks 

the word robot was introduced to the public by the czech interwar writer karel čapek in his play   r u r   rossum s universal robots     published in 1920  the play begins in a factory that uses a chemical substitute for protoplasm to manufacture living  simplified people called robots  the play does not focus in detail on the technology behind the creation of these living creatures  but in their appearance they prefigure modern ideas of androids  creatures who can be mistaken for humans  these mass produced workers are depicted as efficient but emotionless  incapable of original thinking and indifferent to self preservation  at issue is whether the robots are being exploited and the consequences of human dependence upon commodified labor  especially after a number of specially formulated robots achieve self awareness and incite robots all around the world to rise up against the humans   karel čapek himself did not coin the word  he wrote a short letter in reference to an etymology in the oxford english dictionary in which he named his brother  the painter and writer josef čapek  as its actual originator  in an article in the czech journal lidové noviny in 1933  he explained that he had originally wanted to call the creatures laboři   workers   from latin labor   however  he did not like the word  and sought advice from his brother josef  who suggested  roboti   the word robota means literally  corvée    serf labor   and figuratively  drudgery  or  hard work  in czech and also  more general   work    labor  in many slavic languages  e g   bulgarian  russian  serbian  slovak  polish  macedonian  ukrainian  archaic czech  as well as robot in hungarian   traditionally the robota  hungarian robot  was the work period a serf  corvée  had to give for his lord  typically 6 months of the year  the origin of the word is the old church slavonic  old bulgarian  rabota  servitude    work  in contemporary bulgarian and russian   which in turn comes from the proto indo european root  orbh   robot is cognate with the german root arbeit  work   the word robotics  used to describe this field of study  was coined by the science fiction writer isaac asimov  asimov created the  three laws of robotics  which are a recurring theme in his books  these have since been used by many others to define laws used in fiction   the three laws are pure fiction  and no technology yet created has the ability to understand or follow them  and in fact most robots serve military purposes  which run quite contrary to the first law and often the third law   people think about asimov s laws  but they were set up to point out how a simple ethical system doesn t work  if you read the short stories  every single one is about a failure  and they are totally impractical   said dr  joanna bryson of the university of bath   



mobile robots have the capability to move around in their environment and are not fixed to one physical location  an example of a mobile robot that is in common use today is the automated guided vehicle or automatic guided vehicle  agv   an agv is a mobile robot that follows markers or wires in the floor  or uses vision or lasers  agvs are discussed later in this article  mobile robots are also found in industry  military and security environments  they also appear as consumer products  for entertainment or to perform certain tasks like vacuum cleaning  mobile robots are the focus of a great deal of current research and almost every major university has one or more labs that focus on mobile robot research  mobile robots are usually used in tightly controlled environments such as on assembly lines because they have difficulty responding to unexpected interference  because of this most humans rarely encounter robots  however domestic robots for cleaning and maintenance are increasingly common in and around homes in developed countries  robots can also be found in military applications 

industrial robots usually consist of a jointed arm  multi linked manipulator  and an end effector that is attached to a fixed surface  one of the most common type of end effector is a gripper assembly  the international organization for standardization gives a definition of a manipulating industrial robot in iso 8373   an automatically controlled  reprogrammable  multipurpose  manipulator programmable in three or more axes  which may be either fixed in place or mobile for use in industrial automation applications   this definition is used by the international federation of robotics  the european robotics research network  euron  and many national standards committees  <  see talk page as riofa is in disute  the robotics institute of america  ria  uses a broader definition  a robot is a  re programmable multi functional manipulator designed to move materials  parts  tools  or specialized devices through variable programmed motions for the performance of a variety of tasks   the ria subdivides robots into four classes  devices that manipulate objects with manual control  automated devices that manipulate objects with predetermined cycles  programmable and servo controlled robots with continuous point to point trajectories  and robots of this last type which also acquire information from the environment and move intelligently in response    >

most commonly industrial robots are fixed robotic arms and manipulators used primarily for production and distribution of goods  the term  service robot  is less well defined  the international federation of robotics has proposed a tentative definition   a service robot is a robot which operates semi  or fully autonomously to perform services useful to the well being of humans and equipment  excluding manufacturing operations  

robots are used as educational assistants to teachers  from the 1980s  robots such as turtles were used in schools and programmed using the logo language  there are robot kits like lego mindstorms  bioloid  ollo from robotis  or botbrain educational robots can help children to learn about mathematics  physics  programming  and electronics  robotics have also been introduced into the lives of elementary and high school students in the form of robot competitions with the company first  for inspiration and recognition of science and technology   the organization is the foundation for the first robotics competition  first lego league  junior first lego league  and first tech challenge competitions  there have also been devices shaped like robots such as the teaching computer  leachim  1974   and 2 xl  1976   a robot shaped game   teaching toy based on an 8 track tape player  both invented michael j  freeman 

modular robots are a new breed of robots that are designed to increase the utilization of robots by modularizing their architecture  the functionality and effectiveness of a modular robot is easier to increase compared to conventional robots  these robots are composed of a single type of identical  several different identical module types  or similarly shaped modules  which vary in size  their architectural structure allows hyper redundancy for modular robots  as they can be designed with more than 8 degrees of freedom  dof   creating the programming  inverse kinematics and dynamics for modular robots is more complex than with traditional robots  modular robots may be composed of l shaped modules  cubic modules  and u and h shaped modules  anat technology  an early modular robotic technology patented by robotics design inc   allows the creation of modular robots from u and h shaped modules that connect in a chain  and are used to form heterogeneous and homogenous modular robot systems  these  anat robots  can be designed with  n  dof as each module is a complete motorized robotic system that folds relatively to the modules connected before and after it in its chain  and therefore a single module allows one degree of freedom  the more modules that are connected to one another  the more degrees of freedom it will have  l shaped modules can also be designed in a chain  and must become increasingly smaller as the size of the chain increases  as payloads attached to the end of the chain place a greater strain on modules that are further from the base  anat h shaped modules do not suffer from this problem  as their design allows a modular robot to distribute pressure and impacts evenly amongst other attached modules  and therefore payload carrying capacity does not decrease as the length of the arm increases  modular robots can be manually or self reconfigured to form a different robot  that may perform different applications  because modular robots of the same architecture type are composed of modules that compose different modular robots  a snake arm robot can combine with another to form a dual or quadra arm robot  or can split into several mobile robots  and mobile robots can split into multiple smaller ones  or combine with others into a larger or different one  this allows a single modular robot the ability to be fully specialized in a single task  as well as the capacity to be specialized to perform multiple different tasks  modular robotic technology is currently being applied in hybrid transportation  industrial automation  duct cleaning and handling  many research centres and universities have also studied this technology  and have developed prototypes 

a collaborative robot or cobot is a robot that can safely and effectively interact with human workers while performing simple industrial tasks  however  end effectors and other environmental conditions may create hazards  and as such risk assessments should be done before using any industrial motion control application  the collaborative robots most widely used in industries today are manufactured by universal robots in denmark  rethink robotics—founded by rodney brooks  previously with irobot—introduced baxter in september 2012  as an industrial robot designed to safely interact with neighboring human workers  and be programmable for performing simple tasks  baxters stop if they detect a human in the way of their robotic arms and have prominent off switches  intended for sale to small businesses  they are promoted as the robotic analogue of the personal computer    190 companies in the us have bought baxters and they are being used commercially in the uk 

roughly half of all the robots in the world are in asia  32  in europe  and 16  in north america  1  in australasia and 1  in africa  40  of all the robots in the world are in japan  making japan the country with the highest number of robots 

as robots have become more advanced and sophisticated  experts and academics have increasingly explored the questions of what ethics might govern robots  behavior  and whether robots might be able to claim any kind of social  cultural  ethical or legal rights  one scientific team has said that it is possible that a robot brain will exist by 2019  others predict robot intelligence breakthroughs by 2050  recent advances have made robotic behavior more sophisticated  the social impact of intelligent robots is subject of a 2010 documentary film called plug   pray  vernor vinge has suggested that a moment may come when computers and robots are smarter than humans  he calls this  the singularity   he suggests that it may be somewhat or possibly very dangerous for humans  this is discussed by a philosophy called singularitarianism  in 2009  experts attended a conference hosted by the association for the advancement of artificial intelligence  aaai  to discuss whether computers and robots might be able to acquire any autonomy  and how much these abilities might pose a threat or hazard  they noted that some robots have acquired various forms of semi autonomy  including being able to find power sources on their own and being able to independently choose targets to attack with weapons  they also noted that some computer viruses can evade elimination and have achieved  cockroach intelligence   they noted that self awareness as depicted in science fiction is probably unlikely  but that there were other potential hazards and pitfalls  various media sources and scientific groups have noted separate trends in differing areas which might together result in greater robotic functionalities and autonomy  and which pose some inherent concerns  in 2015  the nao alderen robots were shown to have a capability for a degree of self awareness  researchers at the rensselaer polytechnic institute ai and reasoning lab in new york conducted an experiment where a robot became aware of itself  and corrected its answer to a question once it had realised this 

some experts and academics have questioned the use of robots for military combat  especially when such robots are given some degree of autonomous functions  there are also concerns about technology which might allow some armed robots to be controlled mainly by other robots  the us navy has funded a report which indicates that  as military robots become more complex  there should be greater attention to implications of their ability to make autonomous decisions  one researcher states that autonomous robots might be more humane  as they could make decisions more effectively  however  other experts question this  one robot in particular  the eatr  has generated public concerns over its fuel source  as it can continually refuel itself using organic substances  although the engine for the eatr is designed to run on biomass and vegetation specifically selected by its sensors  which it can find on battlefields or other local environments  the project has stated that chicken fat can also be used  manuel de landa has noted that  smart missiles  and autonomous bombs equipped with artificial perception can be considered robots  as they make some of their decisions autonomously  he believes this represents an important and dangerous trend in which humans are handing over important decisions to machines 

for centuries  people have predicted that machines would make workers obsolete and increase unemployment  although the causes of unemployment are usually thought to be due to social policy  a recent example of human replacement involves taiwanese technology company foxconn who  in july 2011  announced a three year plan to replace workers with more robots  at present the company uses ten thousand robots but will increase them to a million robots over a three year period  lawyers have speculated that an increased prevalence of robots in the workplace could lead to the need to improve redundancy laws  kevin j  delaney said  robots are taking human jobs  but bill gates believes that governments should tax companies’ use of them  as a way to at least temporarily slow the spread of automation and to fund other types of employment   the robot tax would also help pay a guaranteed living wage to the displaced workers 

at present  there are two main types of robots  based on their use  general purpose autonomous robots and dedicated robots  robots can be classified by their specificity of purpose  a robot might be designed to perform one particular task extremely well  or a range of tasks less well  all robots by their nature can be re programmed to behave differently  but some are limited by their physical form  for example  a factory robot arm can perform jobs such as cutting  welding  gluing  or acting as a fairground ride  while a pick and place robot can only populate printed circuit boards 

general purpose autonomous robots can perform a variety of functions independently  general purpose autonomous robots typically can navigate independently in known spaces  handle their own re charging needs  interface with electronic doors and elevators and perform other basic tasks  like computers  general purpose robots can link with networks  software and accessories that increase their usefulness  they may recognize people or objects  talk  provide companionship  monitor environmental quality  respond to alarms  pick up supplies and perform other useful tasks  general purpose robots may perform a variety of functions simultaneously or they may take on different roles at different times of day  some such robots try to mimic human beings and may even resemble people in appearance  this type of robot is called a humanoid robot  humanoid robots are still in a very limited stage  as no humanoid robot can  as of yet  actually navigate around a room that it has never been in  thus  humanoid robots are really quite limited  despite their intelligent behaviors in their well known environments 



over the last three decades  automobile factories have become dominated by robots  a typical factory contains hundreds of industrial robots working on fully automated production lines  with one robot for every ten human workers  on an automated production line  a vehicle chassis on a conveyor is welded  glued  painted and finally assembled at a sequence of robot stations 

industrial robots are also used extensively for palletizing and packaging of manufactured goods  for example for rapidly taking drink cartons from the end of a conveyor belt and placing them into boxes  or for loading and unloading machining centers 

mass produced printed circuit boards  pcbs  are almost exclusively manufactured by pick and place robots  typically with scara manipulators  which remove tiny electronic components from strips or trays  and place them on to pcbs with great accuracy  such robots can place hundreds of thousands of components per hour  far out performing a human in speed  accuracy  and reliability 

mobile robots  following markers or wires in the floor  or using vision or lasers  are used to transport goods around large facilities  such as warehouses  container ports  or hospitals 

limited to tasks that could be accurately defined and had to be performed the same way every time  very little feedback or intelligence was required  and the robots needed only the most basic  sensors   the limitations of these agvs are that their paths are not easily altered and they cannot alter their paths if obstacles block them  if one agv breaks down  it may stop the entire operation 

developed to deploy triangulation from beacons or bar code grids for scanning on the floor or ceiling  in most factories  triangulation systems tend to require moderate to high maintenance  such as daily cleaning of all beacons or bar codes  also  if a tall pallet or large vehicle blocks beacons or a bar code is marred  agvs may become lost  often such agvs are designed to be used in human free environments 

such as smartloader  speciminder  adam  tug eskorta  and mt 400 with motivity are designed for people friendly workspaces  they navigate by recognizing natural features  3d scanners or other means of sensing the environment in two or three dimensions help to eliminate cumulative errors in dead reckoning calculations of the agv s current position  some agvs can create maps of their environment using scanning lasers with simultaneous localization and mapping  slam  and use those maps to navigate in real time with other path planning and obstacle avoidance algorithms  they are able to operate in complex environments and perform non repetitive and non sequential tasks such as transporting photomasks in a semiconductor lab  specimens in hospitals and goods in warehouses  for dynamic areas  such as warehouses full of pallets  agvs require additional strategies using three dimensional sensors such as time of flight or stereovision cameras 

there are many jobs which humans would rather leave to robots  the job may be boring  such as domestic cleaning  or dangerous  such as exploring inside a volcano  other jobs are physically inaccessible  such as exploring another planet  cleaning the inside of a long pipe  or performing laparoscopic surgery 

almost every unmanned space probe ever launched was a robot  some were launched in the 1960s with very limited abilities  but their ability to fly and land  in the case of luna 9  is an indication of their status as a robot  this includes the voyager probes and the galileo probes  among others 

teleoperated robots  or telerobots  are devices remotely operated from a distance by a human operator rather than following a predetermined sequence of movements  but which has semi autonomous behaviour  they are used when a human cannot be present on site to perform a job because it is dangerous  far away  or inaccessible  the robot may be in another room or another country  or may be on a very different scale to the operator  for instance  a laparoscopic surgery robot allows the surgeon to work inside a human patient on a relatively small scale compared to open surgery  significantly shortening recovery time  they can also be used to avoid exposing workers to the hazardous and tight spaces such as in duct cleaning <      > when disabling a bomb  the operator sends a small robot to disable it  several authors have been using a device called the longpen to sign books remotely  teleoperated robot aircraft  like the predator unmanned aerial vehicle  are increasingly being used by the military  these pilotless drones can search terrain and fire on targets  hundreds of robots such as irobot s packbot and the foster miller talon are being used in iraq and afghanistan by the u s  military to defuse roadside bombs or improvised explosive devices  ieds  in an activity known as explosive ordnance disposal  eod  

robots are used to automate picking fruit on orchards at a cost lower than that of human pickers 

domestic robots are simple robots dedicated to a single task work in home use  they are used in simple but unwanted jobs  such as vacuum cleaning  floor washing  and lawn mowing  an example of a domestic robot is a roomba 

military robots include the swords robot which is currently used in ground based combat  it can use a variety of weapons and there is some discussion of giving it some degree of autonomy in battleground situations  unmanned combat air vehicles  ucavs   which are an upgraded form of uavs  can do a wide variety of missions  including combat  ucavs are being designed such as the bae systems mantis which would have the ability to fly themselves  to pick their own course and target  and to make most decisions on their own  the bae taranis is a ucav built by great britain which can fly across continents without a pilot and has new means to avoid detection  flight trials are expected to begin in 2011  the aaai has studied this topic in depth and its president has commissioned a study to look at this issue  some have suggested a need to build  friendly ai   meaning that the advances which are already occurring with ai should also include an effort to make ai intrinsically friendly and humane  several such measures reportedly already exist  with robot heavy countries such as japan and south korea having begun to pass regulations requiring robots to be equipped with safety systems  and possibly sets of  laws  akin to asimov s three laws of robotics  an official report was issued in 2009 by the japanese government s robot industry policy committee  chinese officials and researchers have issued a report suggesting a set of ethical rules  and a set of new legal guidelines referred to as  robot legal studies   some concern has been expressed over a possible occurrence of robots telling apparent falsehoods 

mining robots are designed to solve a number of problems currently facing the mining industry  including skills shortages  improving productivity from declining ore grades  and achieving environmental targets  due to the hazardous nature of mining  in particular underground mining  the prevalence of autonomous  semi autonomous  and tele operated robots has greatly increased in recent times  a number of vehicle manufacturers provide autonomous trains  trucks and loaders that will load material  transport it on the mine site to its destination  and unload without requiring human intervention  one of the world s largest mining corporations  rio tinto  has recently expanded its autonomous truck fleet to the world s largest  consisting of 150 autonomous komatsu trucks  operating in western australia  similarly  bhp has announced the expansion of its autonomous drill fleet to the world s largest  21 autonomous atlas copco drills  drilling  longwall and rockbreaking machines are now also available as autonomous robots  the atlas copco rig control system can autonomously execute a drilling plan on a drilling rig  moving the rig into position using gps  set up the drill rig and drill down to specified depths  similarly  the transmin rocklogic system can automatically plan a path to position a rockbreaker at a selected destination  these systems greatly enhance the safety and efficiency of mining operations 

robots in healthcare have two main functions  those which assist an individual  such as a sufferer of a disease like multiple sclerosis  and those which aid in the overall systems such as pharmacies and hospitals 

robots used in home automation have developed over time from simple basic robotic assistants  such as the handy 1  through to semi autonomous robots  such as friend which can assist the elderly and disabled with common tasks  the population is aging in many countries  especially japan  meaning that there are increasing numbers of elderly people to care for  but relatively fewer young people to care for them  humans make the best carers  but where they are unavailable  robots are gradually being introduced  friend is a semi autonomous robot designed to support disabled and elderly people in their daily life activities  like preparing and serving a meal  friend make it possible for patients who are paraplegic  have muscle diseases or serious paralysis  due to strokes etc    to perform tasks without help from other people like therapists or nursing staff 

script pro manufactures a robot designed to help pharmacies fill prescriptions that consist of oral solids or medications in pill form  the pharmacist or pharmacy technician enters the prescription information into its information system  the system  upon determining whether or not the drug is in the robot  will send the information to the robot for filling  the robot has 3 different size vials to fill determined by the size of the pill  the robot technician  user  or pharmacist determines the needed size of the vial based on the tablet when the robot is stocked  once the vial is filled it is brought up to a conveyor belt that delivers it to a holder that spins the vial and attaches the patient label  afterwards it is set on another conveyor that delivers the patient s medication vial to a slot labeled with the patient s name on an led read out  the pharmacist or technician then checks the contents of the vial to ensure it s the correct drug for the correct patient and then seals the vials and sends it out front to be picked up  the robot is a very time efficient device that the pharmacy depends on to fill prescriptions  mckesson s robot rx is another healthcare robotics product that helps pharmacies dispense thousands of medications daily with little or no errors  the robot can be ten feet wide and thirty feet long and can hold hundreds of different kinds of medications and thousands of doses  the pharmacy saves many resources like staff members that are otherwise unavailable in a resource scarce industry  it uses an electromechanical head coupled with a pneumatic system to capture each dose and deliver it to its either stocked or dispensed location  the head moves along a single axis while it rotates 180 degrees to pull the medications  during this process it uses barcode technology to verify its pulling the correct drug  it then delivers the drug to a patient specific bin on a conveyor belt  once the bin is filled with all of the drugs that a particular patient needs and that the robot stocks  the bin is then released and returned out on the conveyor belt to a technician waiting to load it into a cart for delivery to the floor 

while most robots today are installed in factories or homes  performing labour or life saving jobs  many new types of robot are being developed in laboratories around the world  much of the research in robotics focuses not on specific industrial tasks  but on investigations into new types of robot  alternative ways to think about or design robots  and new ways to manufacture them  it is expected that these new types of robot will be able to solve real world problems when they are finally realized 

one approach to designing robots is to base them on animals  bionickangaroo was designed and engineered by studying and applying the physiology and methods of locomotion of a kangaroo 

nanorobotics is the emerging technology field of creating machines or robots whose components are at or close to the microscopic scale of a nanometer  10 −9 meters   also known as  nanobots  or  nanites   they would be constructed from molecular machines  so far  researchers have mostly produced only parts of these complex systems  such as bearings  sensors  and synthetic molecular motors  but functioning robots have also been made such as the entrants to the nanobot robocup contest  researchers also hope to be able to create entire robots as small as viruses or bacteria  which could perform tasks on a tiny scale  possible applications include micro surgery  on the level of individual cells   utility fog  manufacturing  weaponry and cleaning  some people have suggested that if there were nanobots which could reproduce  the earth would turn into  grey goo   while others argue that this hypothetical outcome is nonsense 

a few researchers have investigated the possibility of creating robots which can alter their physical form to suit a particular task  like the fictional t 1000  real robots are nowhere near that sophisticated however  and mostly consist of a small number of cube shaped units  which can move relative to their neighbours  algorithms have been designed in case any such robots become a reality 

robots with silicone bodies and flexible actuators  air muscles  electroactive polymers  and ferrofluids  look and feel different from robots with rigid skeletons  and can have different behaviors 

inspired by colonies of insects such as ants and bees  researchers are modeling the behavior of swarms of thousands of tiny robots which together perform a useful task  such as finding something hidden  cleaning  or spying  each robot is quite simple  but the emergent behavior of the swarm is more complex  the whole set of robots can be considered as one single distributed system  in the same way an ant colony can be considered a superorganism  exhibiting swarm intelligence  the largest swarms so far created include the irobot swarm  the sri mobilerobots centibots project and the open source micro robotic project swarm  which are being used to research collective behaviors  swarms are also more resistant to failure  whereas one large robot may fail and ruin a mission  a swarm can continue even if several robots fail  this could make them attractive for space exploration missions  where failure is normally extremely costly 

robotics also has application in the design of virtual reality interfaces  specialized robots are in widespread use in the haptic research community  these robots  called  haptic interfaces   allow touch enabled user interaction with real and virtual environments  robotic forces allow simulating the mechanical properties of  virtual  objects  which users can experience through their sense of touch 



robotic characters  androids  artificial men women  or gynoids  artificial women   and cyborgs  also  bionic men women   or humans with significant mechanical enhancements  have become a staple of science fiction  the first reference in western literature to mechanical servants appears in homer s iliad  in book xviii  hephaestus  god of fire  creates new armor for the hero achilles  assisted by robots  according to the rieu translation   golden maidservants hastened to help their master  they looked like real women and could not only speak and use their limbs but were endowed with intelligence and trained in handwork by the immortal gods   the words  robot  or  android  are not used to describe them  but they are nevertheless mechanical devices human in appearance   the first use of the word robot was in karel čapek s play r u r   rossum s universal robots   written in 1920    writer karel čapek was born in czechoslovakia  czech republic   possibly the most prolific author of the twentieth century was isaac asimov  1920–1992  who published over five hundred books  asimov is probably best remembered for his science fiction stories and especially those about robots  where he placed robots and their interaction with society at the center of many of his works  asimov carefully considered the problem of the ideal set of instructions robots might be given in order to lower the risk to humans  and arrived at his three laws of robotics  a robot may not injure a human being or  through inaction  allow a human being to come to harm  a robot must obey orders given it by human beings  except where such orders would conflict with the first law  and a robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the first or second law  these were introduced in his 1942 short story  runaround   although foreshadowed in a few earlier stories  later  asimov added the zeroth law   a robot may not harm humanity  or  by inaction  allow humanity to come to harm   the rest of the laws are modified sequentially to acknowledge this  according to the oxford english dictionary  the first passage in asimov s short story  liar    1941  that mentions the first law is the earliest recorded use of the word robotics  asimov was not initially aware of this  he assumed the word already existed by analogy with mechanics  hydraulics  and other similar terms denoting branches of applied knowledge 

robots appear in many films  most of the robots in cinema are fictional  two of the most famous are r2 d2 and c 3po from the star wars franchise 

the concept of humanoid sex robots has elicited both public attention and concern  opponents of the concept have stated that the development of sex robots would be morally wrong  they argue that the introduction of such devices would be socially harmful  and demeaning to women and children 

fears and concerns about robots have been repeatedly expressed in a wide range of books and films  a common theme is the development of a master race of conscious and highly intelligent robots  motivated to take over or destroy the human race  frankenstein  1818   often called the first science fiction novel  has become synonymous with the theme of a robot or android advancing beyond its creator  other works with similar themes include the mechanical man  the terminator  runaway  robocop  the replicators in stargate  the cylons in battlestar galactica  the cybermen and daleks in doctor who  the matrix  enthiran and i  robot  some fictional robots are programmed to kill and destroy  others gain superhuman intelligence and abilities by upgrading their own software and hardware  examples of popular media where the robot becomes evil are 2001  a space odyssey  red planet and enthiran  the 2017 game horizon zero dawn explores themes of robotics in warfare  robot ethics  and the ai control problem  as well as the positive or negative impact such technologies could have on the environment  another common theme is the reaction  sometimes called the  uncanny valley   of unease and even revulsion at the sight of robots that mimic humans too closely  more recently  fictional representations of artificially intelligent robots in films such as a i  artificial intelligence and ex machina and the 2016 tv adaptation of westworld have engaged audience sympathy for the robots themselves 













a robot is a machine—especially one programmable by a computer— capable of carrying out a complex series of actions automatically  robots can be guided by an external control device or the control may be embedded within  robots may be constructed to take on human form but most robots are machines designed to perform a task with no regard to how they look  robots can be autonomous or semi autonomous and range from humanoids such as honda s advanced step in innovative mobility  asimo  and tosy s tosy ping pong playing robot  topio  to industrial robots  medical operating robots  patient assist robots  dog therapy robots  collectively programmed swarm robots  uav drones such as general atomics mq 1 predator  and even microscopic nano robots  by mimicking a lifelike appearance or automating movements  a robot may convey a sense of intelligence or thought of its own  autonomous things are expected to proliferate in the coming decade  with home robotics and the autonomous car as some of the main drivers  the branch of technology that deals with the design  construction  operation  and application of robots  as well as computer systems for their control  sensory feedback  and information processing is robotics  these technologies deal with automated machines that can take the place of humans in dangerous environments or manufacturing processes  or resemble humans in appearance  behavior  or cognition  many of today s robots are inspired by nature contributing to the field of bio inspired robotics  these robots have also created a newer branch of robotics  soft robotics  from the time of ancient civilization there have been many accounts of user configurable automated devices and even automata resembling animals and humans  designed primarily as entertainment  as mechanical techniques developed through the industrial age  there appeared more practical applications such as automated machines  remote control and wireless remote control  the term comes from a czech word  robota  meaning  forced labor   the word  robot  was first used to denote a fictional humanoid in a 1920 play r u r  by the czech writer  karel čapek but it was karel s brother josef čapek who was the word s true inventor  electronics evolved into the driving force of development with the advent of the first electronic autonomous robots created by william grey walter in bristol  england in 1948  as well as computer numerical control  cnc  machine tools in the late 1940s by john t  parsons and frank l  stulen  the first commercial  digital and programmable robot was built by george devol in 1954 and was named the unimate  it was sold to general motors in 1961 where it was used to lift pieces of hot metal from die casting machines at the inland fisher guide plant in the west trenton section of ewing township  new jersey  robots have replaced humans in performing repetitive and dangerous tasks which humans prefer not to do  or are unable to do because of size limitations  or which take place in extreme environments such as outer space or the bottom of the sea  there are concerns about the increasing use of robots and their role in society  robots are blamed for rising technological unemployment as they replace workers in increasing numbers of functions  the use of robots in military combat raises ethical concerns  the possibilities of robot autonomy and potential repercussions have been addressed in fiction and may be a realistic concern in the future 

the word robot can refer to both physical robots and virtual software agents  but the latter are usually referred to as bots  there is no consensus on which machines qualify as robots but there is general agreement among experts  and the public  that robots tend to possess some or all of the following abilities and functions  accept electronic programming  process data or physical perceptions electronically  operate autonomously to some degree  move around  operate physical parts of itself or physical processes  sense and manipulate their environment  and exhibit intelligent behavior  especially behavior which mimics humans or other animals  closely related to the concept of a robot is the field of synthetic biology  which studies entities whose nature is more comparable to beings than to machines 

the idea of automata originates in the mythologies of many cultures around the world  engineers and inventors from ancient civilizations  including ancient china  ancient greece  and ptolemaic egypt  attempted to build self operating machines  some resembling animals and humans  early descriptions of automata include the artificial doves of archytas  the artificial birds of mozi and lu ban  a  speaking  automaton by hero of alexandria  a washstand automaton by philo of byzantium  and a human automaton described in the lie zi 

many ancient mythologies  and most modern religions include artificial people  such as the mechanical servants built by the greek god hephaestus  vulcan to the romans   the clay golems of jewish legend and clay giants of norse legend  and galatea  the mythical statue of pygmalion that came to life  since circa 400 bc  myths of crete include talos  a man of bronze who guarded the cretan island of europa from pirates  in ancient greece  the greek engineer ctesibius  c  270 bc   applied a knowledge of pneumatics and hydraulics to produce the first organ and water clocks with moving figures   in the 4th century bc  the greek mathematician archytas of tarentum postulated a mechanical steam operated bird he called  the pigeon   hero of alexandria  10–70 ad   a greek mathematician and inventor  created numerous user configurable automated devices  and described machines powered by air pressure  steam and water  the 11th century lokapannatti tells of how the buddha s relics were protected by mechanical robots  bhuta vahana yanta   from the kingdom of roma visaya  rome   until they were disarmed by king ashoka  in ancient china  the 3rd century text of the lie zi describes an account of humanoid automata  involving a much earlier encounter between chinese emperor king mu of zhou and a mechanical engineer known as yan shi  an  artificer   yan shi proudly presented the king with a life size  human shaped figure of his mechanical  handiwork  made of leather  wood  and artificial organs  there are also accounts of flying automata in the han fei zi and other texts  which attributes the 5th century bc mohist philosopher mozi and his contemporary lu ban with the invention of artificial wooden birds  ma yuan  that could successfully fly  in 1066  the chinese inventor su song built a water clock in the form of a tower which featured mechanical figurines which chimed the hours  the beginning of automata is associated with the invention of early su song s astronomical clock tower featured mechanical figurines that chimed the hours  his mechanism had a programmable drum machine with pegs  cams  that bumped into little levers that operated percussion instruments  the drummer could be made to play different rhythms and different drum patterns by moving the pegs to different locations  samarangana sutradhara  a sanskrit treatise by bhoja  11th century   includes a chapter about the construction of mechanical contrivances  automata   including mechanical bees and birds  fountains shaped like humans and animals  and male and female dolls that refilled oil lamps  danced  played instruments  and re enacted scenes from hindu mythology  in renaissance italy  leonardo da vinci  1452–1519  sketched plans for a humanoid robot around 1495  da vinci s notebooks  rediscovered in the 1950s  contained detailed drawings of a mechanical knight now known as leonardo s robot  able to sit up  wave its arms and move its head and jaw  the design was probably based on anatomical research recorded in his vitruvian man  it is not known whether he attempted to build it in japan  complex animal and human automata were built between the 17th to 19th centuries  with many described in the 18th century karakuri zui  illustrated machinery  1796   one such automaton was the karakuri ningyō  a mechanized puppet  different variations of the karakuri existed  the butai karakuri  which were used in theatre  the zashiki karakuri  which were small and used in homes  and the dashi karakuri which were used in religious festivals  where the puppets were used to perform reenactments of traditional myths and legends  in france  between 1738 and 1739  jacques de vaucanson exhibited several life sized automatons  a flute player  a pipe player and a duck  the mechanical duck could flap its wings  crane its neck  and swallow food from the exhibitor s hand  and it gave the illusion of digesting its food by excreting matter stored in a hidden compartment 

remotely operated vehicles were demonstrated in the late 19th century in the form of several types of remotely controlled torpedoes  the early 1870s saw remotely controlled torpedoes by john ericsson  pneumatic   john louis lay  electric wire guided   and victor von scheliha  electric wire guided   the brennan torpedo  invented by louis brennan in 1877 was powered by two contra rotating propellors that were spun by rapidly pulling out wires from drums wound inside the torpedo  differential speed on the wires connected to the shore station allowed the torpedo to be guided to its target  making it  the world s first practical guided missile   in 1897 the british inventor ernest wilson was granted a patent for a torpedo remotely controlled by  hertzian   radio  waves and in 1898 nikola tesla publicly demonstrated a wireless controlled torpedo that he hoped to sell to the us navy  archibald low  known as the  father of radio guidance systems  for his pioneering work on guided rockets and planes during the first world war  in 1917  he demonstrated a remote controlled aircraft to the royal flying corps and in the same year built the first wire guided rocket 

 robot  was first applied as a term for artificial automata in a 1920 play r u r  by the czech writer  karel čapek  however  josef čapek was named by his brother karel as the true inventor of the term robot  the word  robot  itself was not new  having been in slavic language as robota  forced laborer   a term which classified those peasants obligated to compulsory service under the feudal system widespread in 19th century europe  see  robot patent   čapek s fictional story postulated the technological creation of artificial human bodies without souls  and the old theme of the feudal robota class eloquently fit the imagination of a new class of manufactured  artificial workers 

in 1928  one of the first humanoid robots  eric  was exhibited at the annual exhibition of the model engineers society in london  where it delivered a speech  invented by w  h  richards  the robot s frame consisted of an aluminium body of armour with eleven electromagnets and one motor powered by a twelve volt power source  the robot could move its hands and head and could be controlled through remote control or voice control  both eric and his  brother  george toured the world  westinghouse electric corporation built televox in 1926  it was a cardboard cutout connected to various devices which users could turn on and off  in 1939  the humanoid robot known as elektro was debuted at the 1939 new york world s fair  seven feet tall  2 1 m  and weighing 265 pounds  120 2 kg   it could walk by voice command  speak about 700 words  using a 78 rpm record player   smoke cigarettes  blow up balloons  and move its head and arms  the body consisted of a steel gear  cam and motor skeleton covered by an aluminum skin  in 1928  japan s first robot  gakutensoku  was designed and constructed by biologist makoto nishimura 

the first electronic autonomous robots with complex behaviour were created by william grey walter of the burden neurological institute at bristol  england in 1948 and 1949  he wanted to prove that rich connections between a small number of brain cells could give rise to very complex behaviors – essentially that the secret of how the brain worked lay in how it was wired up  his first robots  named elmer and elsie  were constructed between 1948 and 1949 and were often described as tortoises due to their shape and slow rate of movement  the three wheeled tortoise robots were capable of phototaxis  by which they could find their way to a recharging station when they ran low on battery power  walter stressed the importance of using purely electronics to simulate brain processes at a time when his contemporaries such as alan turing and john von neumann were all turning towards a view of mental processes in terms of digital computation  his work inspired subsequent generations of robotics researchers such as rodney brooks  hans moravec and mark tilden  modern incarnations of walter s turtles may be found in the form of beam robotics  the first digitally operated and programmable robot was invented by george devol in 1954 and was ultimately called the unimate  this ultimately laid the foundations of the modern robotics industry  devol sold the first unimate to general motors in 1960  and it was installed in 1961 in a plant in trenton  new jersey to lift hot pieces of metal from a die casting machine and stack them  devol s patent for the first digitally operated programmable robotic arm represents the foundation of the modern robotics industry  the first palletizing robot was introduced in 1963 by the fuji yusoki kogyo company  in 1973  a robot with six electromechanically driven axes was patented   by kuka robotics in germany  and the programmable universal manipulation arm was invented by victor scheinman in 1976  and the design was sold to unimation  commercial and industrial robots are now in widespread use performing jobs more cheaply or with greater accuracy and reliability than humans  they are also employed for jobs which are too dirty  dangerous or dull to be suitable for humans  robots are widely used in manufacturing  assembly and packing  transport  earth and space exploration  surgery  weaponry  laboratory research  and mass production of consumer and industrial goods 

various techniques have emerged to develop the science of robotics and robots  one method is evolutionary robotics  in which a number of differing robots are submitted to tests  those which perform best are used as a model to create a subsequent  generation  of robots  another method is developmental robotics  which tracks changes and development within a single robot in the areas of problem solving and other functions  another new type of robot is just recently introduced which acts both as a smartphone and robot and is named robohon  as robots become more advanced  eventually there may be a standard computer operating system designed mainly for robots  robot operating system is an open source set of programs being developed at stanford university  the massachusetts institute of technology and the technical university of munich  germany  among others  ros provides ways to program a robot s navigation and limbs regardless of the specific hardware involved  it also provides high level commands for items like image recognition and even opening doors  when ros boots up on a robot s computer  it would obtain data on attributes such as the length and movement of robots  limbs  it would relay this data to higher level algorithms  microsoft is also developing a  windows for robots  system with its robotics developer studio  which has been available since 2007  japan hopes to have full scale commercialization of service robots by 2025  much technological research in japan is led by japanese government agencies  particularly the trade ministry  many future applications of robotics seem obvious to people  even though they are well beyond the capabilities of robots available at the time of the prediction  as early as 1982 people were confident that someday robots would  1  clean parts by removing molding flash 2  spray paint automobiles with absolutely no human presence 3  pack things in boxes—for example  orient and nest chocolate candies in candy boxes 4  make electrical cable harness 5  load trucks with boxes—a packing problem 6  handle soft goods  such as garments and shoes 7  shear sheep 8  prosthesis 9  cook fast food and work in other service industries 10  household robot  generally such predictions are overly optimistic in timescale 

in 2008  caterpillar inc  developed a dump truck which can drive itself without any human operator  many analysts believe that self driving trucks may eventually revolutionize logistics  by 2014  caterpillar had a self driving dump truck which is expected to greatly change the process of mining  in 2015  these caterpillar trucks were actively used in mining operations in australia by the mining company rio tinto coal australia  some analysts believe that within the next few decades  most trucks will be self driving  a literate or  reading robot  named marge has intelligence that comes from software  she can read newspapers  find and correct misspelled words  learn about banks like barclays  and understand that some restaurants are better places to eat than others  baxter is a new robot introduced in 2012 which learns by guidance  a worker could teach baxter how to perform a task by moving its hands in the desired motion and having baxter memorize them  extra dials  buttons  and controls are available on baxter s arm for more precision and features  any regular worker could program baxter and it only takes a matter of minutes  unlike usual industrial robots that take extensive programs and coding in order to be used  this means baxter needs no programming in order to operate  no software engineers are needed  this also means baxter can be taught to perform multiple  more complicated tasks  sawyer was added in 2015 for smaller  more precise tasks 

the word robot was introduced to the public by the czech interwar writer karel čapek in his play   r u r   rossum s universal robots     published in 1920  the play begins in a factory that uses a chemical substitute for protoplasm to manufacture living  simplified people called robots  the play does not focus in detail on the technology behind the creation of these living creatures  but in their appearance they prefigure modern ideas of androids  creatures who can be mistaken for humans  these mass produced workers are depicted as efficient but emotionless  incapable of original thinking and indifferent to self preservation  at issue is whether the robots are being exploited and the consequences of human dependence upon commodified labor  especially after a number of specially formulated robots achieve self awareness and incite robots all around the world to rise up against the humans   karel čapek himself did not coin the word  he wrote a short letter in reference to an etymology in the oxford english dictionary in which he named his brother  the painter and writer josef čapek  as its actual originator  in an article in the czech journal lidové noviny in 1933  he explained that he had originally wanted to call the creatures laboři   workers   from latin labor   however  he did not like the word  and sought advice from his brother josef  who suggested  roboti   the word robota means literally  corvée    serf labor   and figuratively  drudgery  or  hard work  in czech and also  more general   work    labor  in many slavic languages  e g   bulgarian  russian  serbian  slovak  polish  macedonian  ukrainian  archaic czech  as well as robot in hungarian   traditionally the robota  hungarian robot  was the work period a serf  corvée  had to give for his lord  typically 6 months of the year  the origin of the word is the old church slavonic  old bulgarian  rabota  servitude    work  in contemporary bulgarian and russian   which in turn comes from the proto indo european root  orbh   robot is cognate with the german root arbeit  work   the word robotics  used to describe this field of study  was coined by the science fiction writer isaac asimov  asimov created the  three laws of robotics  which are a recurring theme in his books  these have since been used by many others to define laws used in fiction   the three laws are pure fiction  and no technology yet created has the ability to understand or follow them  and in fact most robots serve military purposes  which run quite contrary to the first law and often the third law   people think about asimov s laws  but they were set up to point out how a simple ethical system doesn t work  if you read the short stories  every single one is about a failure  and they are totally impractical   said dr  joanna bryson of the university of bath   



mobile robots have the capability to move around in their environment and are not fixed to one physical location  an example of a mobile robot that is in common use today is the automated guided vehicle or automatic guided vehicle  agv   an agv is a mobile robot that follows markers or wires in the floor  or uses vision or lasers  agvs are discussed later in this article  mobile robots are also found in industry  military and security environments  they also appear as consumer products  for entertainment or to perform certain tasks like vacuum cleaning  mobile robots are the focus of a great deal of current research and almost every major university has one or more labs that focus on mobile robot research  mobile robots are usually used in tightly controlled environments such as on assembly lines because they have difficulty responding to unexpected interference  because of this most humans rarely encounter robots  however domestic robots for cleaning and maintenance are increasingly common in and around homes in developed countries  robots can also be found in military applications 

industrial robots usually consist of a jointed arm  multi linked manipulator  and an end effector that is attached to a fixed surface  one of the most common type of end effector is a gripper assembly  the international organization for standardization gives a definition of a manipulating industrial robot in iso 8373   an automatically controlled  reprogrammable  multipurpose  manipulator programmable in three or more axes  which may be either fixed in place or mobile for use in industrial automation applications   this definition is used by the international federation of robotics  the european robotics research network  euron  and many national standards committees  <  see talk page as riofa is in disute  the robotics institute of america  ria  uses a broader definition  a robot is a  re programmable multi functional manipulator designed to move materials  parts  tools  or specialized devices through variable programmed motions for the performance of a variety of tasks   the ria subdivides robots into four classes  devices that manipulate objects with manual control  automated devices that manipulate objects with predetermined cycles  programmable and servo controlled robots with continuous point to point trajectories  and robots of this last type which also acquire information from the environment and move intelligently in response    >

most commonly industrial robots are fixed robotic arms and manipulators used primarily for production and distribution of goods  the term  service robot  is less well defined  the international federation of robotics has proposed a tentative definition   a service robot is a robot which operates semi  or fully autonomously to perform services useful to the well being of humans and equipment  excluding manufacturing operations  

robots are used as educational assistants to teachers  from the 1980s  robots such as turtles were used in schools and programmed using the logo language  there are robot kits like lego mindstorms  bioloid  ollo from robotis  or botbrain educational robots can help children to learn about mathematics  physics  programming  and electronics  robotics have also been introduced into the lives of elementary and high school students in the form of robot competitions with the company first  for inspiration and recognition of science and technology   the organization is the foundation for the first robotics competition  first lego league  junior first lego league  and first tech challenge competitions  there have also been devices shaped like robots such as the teaching computer  leachim  1974   and 2 xl  1976   a robot shaped game   teaching toy based on an 8 track tape player  both invented michael j  freeman 

modular robots are a new breed of robots that are designed to increase the utilization of robots by modularizing their architecture  the functionality and effectiveness of a modular robot is easier to increase compared to conventional robots  these robots are composed of a single type of identical  several different identical module types  or similarly shaped modules  which vary in size  their architectural structure allows hyper redundancy for modular robots  as they can be designed with more than 8 degrees of freedom  dof   creating the programming  inverse kinematics and dynamics for modular robots is more complex than with traditional robots  modular robots may be composed of l shaped modules  cubic modules  and u and h shaped modules  anat technology  an early modular robotic technology patented by robotics design inc   allows the creation of modular robots from u and h shaped modules that connect in a chain  and are used to form heterogeneous and homogenous modular robot systems  these  anat robots  can be designed with  n  dof as each module is a complete motorized robotic system that folds relatively to the modules connected before and after it in its chain  and therefore a single module allows one degree of freedom  the more modules that are connected to one another  the more degrees of freedom it will have  l shaped modules can also be designed in a chain  and must become increasingly smaller as the size of the chain increases  as payloads attached to the end of the chain place a greater strain on modules that are further from the base  anat h shaped modules do not suffer from this problem  as their design allows a modular robot to distribute pressure and impacts evenly amongst other attached modules  and therefore payload carrying capacity does not decrease as the length of the arm increases  modular robots can be manually or self reconfigured to form a different robot  that may perform different applications  because modular robots of the same architecture type are composed of modules that compose different modular robots  a snake arm robot can combine with another to form a dual or quadra arm robot  or can split into several mobile robots  and mobile robots can split into multiple smaller ones  or combine with others into a larger or different one  this allows a single modular robot the ability to be fully specialized in a single task  as well as the capacity to be specialized to perform multiple different tasks  modular robotic technology is currently being applied in hybrid transportation  industrial automation  duct cleaning and handling  many research centres and universities have also studied this technology  and have developed prototypes 

a collaborative robot or cobot is a robot that can safely and effectively interact with human workers while performing simple industrial tasks  however  end effectors and other environmental conditions may create hazards  and as such risk assessments should be done before using any industrial motion control application  the collaborative robots most widely used in industries today are manufactured by universal robots in denmark  rethink robotics—founded by rodney brooks  previously with irobot—introduced baxter in september 2012  as an industrial robot designed to safely interact with neighboring human workers  and be programmable for performing simple tasks  baxters stop if they detect a human in the way of their robotic arms and have prominent off switches  intended for sale to small businesses  they are promoted as the robotic analogue of the personal computer    190 companies in the us have bought baxters and they are being used commercially in the uk 

roughly half of all the robots in the world are in asia  32  in europe  and 16  in north america  1  in australasia and 1  in africa  40  of all the robots in the world are in japan  making japan the country with the highest number of robots 

as robots have become more advanced and sophisticated  experts and academics have increasingly explored the questions of what ethics might govern robots  behavior  and whether robots might be able to claim any kind of social  cultural  ethical or legal rights  one scientific team has said that it is possible that a robot brain will exist by 2019  others predict robot intelligence breakthroughs by 2050  recent advances have made robotic behavior more sophisticated  the social impact of intelligent robots is subject of a 2010 documentary film called plug   pray  vernor vinge has suggested that a moment may come when computers and robots are smarter than humans  he calls this  the singularity   he suggests that it may be somewhat or possibly very dangerous for humans  this is discussed by a philosophy called singularitarianism  in 2009  experts attended a conference hosted by the association for the advancement of artificial intelligence  aaai  to discuss whether computers and robots might be able to acquire any autonomy  and how much these abilities might pose a threat or hazard  they noted that some robots have acquired various forms of semi autonomy  including being able to find power sources on their own and being able to independently choose targets to attack with weapons  they also noted that some computer viruses can evade elimination and have achieved  cockroach intelligence   they noted that self awareness as depicted in science fiction is probably unlikely  but that there were other potential hazards and pitfalls  various media sources and scientific groups have noted separate trends in differing areas which might together result in greater robotic functionalities and autonomy  and which pose some inherent concerns  in 2015  the nao alderen robots were shown to have a capability for a degree of self awareness  researchers at the rensselaer polytechnic institute ai and reasoning lab in new york conducted an experiment where a robot became aware of itself  and corrected its answer to a question once it had realised this 

some experts and academics have questioned the use of robots for military combat  especially when such robots are given some degree of autonomous functions  there are also concerns about technology which might allow some armed robots to be controlled mainly by other robots  the us navy has funded a report which indicates that  as military robots become more complex  there should be greater attention to implications of their ability to make autonomous decisions  one researcher states that autonomous robots might be more humane  as they could make decisions more effectively  however  other experts question this  one robot in particular  the eatr  has generated public concerns over its fuel source  as it can continually refuel itself using organic substances  although the engine for the eatr is designed to run on biomass and vegetation specifically selected by its sensors  which it can find on battlefields or other local environments  the project has stated that chicken fat can also be used  manuel de landa has noted that  smart missiles  and autonomous bombs equipped with artificial perception can be considered robots  as they make some of their decisions autonomously  he believes this represents an important and dangerous trend in which humans are handing over important decisions to machines 

for centuries  people have predicted that machines would make workers obsolete and increase unemployment  although the causes of unemployment are usually thought to be due to social policy  a recent example of human replacement involves taiwanese technology company foxconn who  in july 2011  announced a three year plan to replace workers with more robots  at present the company uses ten thousand robots but will increase them to a million robots over a three year period  lawyers have speculated that an increased prevalence of robots in the workplace could lead to the need to improve redundancy laws  kevin j  delaney said  robots are taking human jobs  but bill gates believes that governments should tax companies’ use of them  as a way to at least temporarily slow the spread of automation and to fund other types of employment   the robot tax would also help pay a guaranteed living wage to the displaced workers 

at present  there are two main types of robots  based on their use  general purpose autonomous robots and dedicated robots  robots can be classified by their specificity of purpose  a robot might be designed to perform one particular task extremely well  or a range of tasks less well  all robots by their nature can be re programmed to behave differently  but some are limited by their physical form  for example  a factory robot arm can perform jobs such as cutting  welding  gluing  or acting as a fairground ride  while a pick and place robot can only populate printed circuit boards 

general purpose autonomous robots can perform a variety of functions independently  general purpose autonomous robots typically can navigate independently in known spaces  handle their own re charging needs  interface with electronic doors and elevators and perform other basic tasks  like computers  general purpose robots can link with networks  software and accessories that increase their usefulness  they may recognize people or objects  talk  provide companionship  monitor environmental quality  respond to alarms  pick up supplies and perform other useful tasks  general purpose robots may perform a variety of functions simultaneously or they may take on different roles at different times of day  some such robots try to mimic human beings and may even resemble people in appearance  this type of robot is called a humanoid robot  humanoid robots are still in a very limited stage  as no humanoid robot can  as of yet  actually navigate around a room that it has never been in  thus  humanoid robots are really quite limited  despite their intelligent behaviors in their well known environments 



over the last three decades  automobile factories have become dominated by robots  a typical factory contains hundreds of industrial robots working on fully automated production lines  with one robot for every ten human workers  on an automated production line  a vehicle chassis on a conveyor is welded  glued  painted and finally assembled at a sequence of robot stations 

industrial robots are also used extensively for palletizing and packaging of manufactured goods  for example for rapidly taking drink cartons from the end of a conveyor belt and placing them into boxes  or for loading and unloading machining centers 

mass produced printed circuit boards  pcbs  are almost exclusively manufactured by pick and place robots  typically with scara manipulators  which remove tiny electronic components from strips or trays  and place them on to pcbs with great accuracy  such robots can place hundreds of thousands of components per hour  far out performing a human in speed  accuracy  and reliability 

mobile robots  following markers or wires in the floor  or using vision or lasers  are used to transport goods around large facilities  such as warehouses  container ports  or hospitals 

limited to tasks that could be accurately defined and had to be performed the same way every time  very little feedback or intelligence was required  and the robots needed only the most basic  sensors   the limitations of these agvs are that their paths are not easily altered and they cannot alter their paths if obstacles block them  if one agv breaks down  it may stop the entire operation 

developed to deploy triangulation from beacons or bar code grids for scanning on the floor or ceiling  in most factories  triangulation systems tend to require moderate to high maintenance  such as daily cleaning of all beacons or bar codes  also  if a tall pallet or large vehicle blocks beacons or a bar code is marred  agvs may become lost  often such agvs are designed to be used in human free environments 

such as smartloader  speciminder  adam  tug eskorta  and mt 400 with motivity are designed for people friendly workspaces  they navigate by recognizing natural features  3d scanners or other means of sensing the environment in two or three dimensions help to eliminate cumulative errors in dead reckoning calculations of the agv s current position  some agvs can create maps of their environment using scanning lasers with simultaneous localization and mapping  slam  and use those maps to navigate in real time with other path planning and obstacle avoidance algorithms  they are able to operate in complex environments and perform non repetitive and non sequential tasks such as transporting photomasks in a semiconductor lab  specimens in hospitals and goods in warehouses  for dynamic areas  such as warehouses full of pallets  agvs require additional strategies using three dimensional sensors such as time of flight or stereovision cameras 

there are many jobs which humans would rather leave to robots  the job may be boring  such as domestic cleaning  or dangerous  such as exploring inside a volcano  other jobs are physically inaccessible  such as exploring another planet  cleaning the inside of a long pipe  or performing laparoscopic surgery 

almost every unmanned space probe ever launched was a robot  some were launched in the 1960s with very limited abilities  but their ability to fly and land  in the case of luna 9  is an indication of their status as a robot  this includes the voyager probes and the galileo probes  among others 

teleoperated robots  or telerobots  are devices remotely operated from a distance by a human operator rather than following a predetermined sequence of movements  but which has semi autonomous behaviour  they are used when a human cannot be present on site to perform a job because it is dangerous  far away  or inaccessible  the robot may be in another room or another country  or may be on a very different scale to the operator  for instance  a laparoscopic surgery robot allows the surgeon to work inside a human patient on a relatively small scale compared to open surgery  significantly shortening recovery time  they can also be used to avoid exposing workers to the hazardous and tight spaces such as in duct cleaning <      > when disabling a bomb  the operator sends a small robot to disable it  several authors have been using a device called the longpen to sign books remotely  teleoperated robot aircraft  like the predator unmanned aerial vehicle  are increasingly being used by the military  these pilotless drones can search terrain and fire on targets  hundreds of robots such as irobot s packbot and the foster miller talon are being used in iraq and afghanistan by the u s  military to defuse roadside bombs or improvised explosive devices  ieds  in an activity known as explosive ordnance disposal  eod  

robots are used to automate picking fruit on orchards at a cost lower than that of human pickers 

domestic robots are simple robots dedicated to a single task work in home use  they are used in simple but unwanted jobs  such as vacuum cleaning  floor washing  and lawn mowing  an example of a domestic robot is a roomba 

military robots include the swords robot which is currently used in ground based combat  it can use a variety of weapons and there is some discussion of giving it some degree of autonomy in battleground situations  unmanned combat air vehicles  ucavs   which are an upgraded form of uavs  can do a wide variety of missions  including combat  ucavs are being designed such as the bae systems mantis which would have the ability to fly themselves  to pick their own course and target  and to make most decisions on their own  the bae taranis is a ucav built by great britain which can fly across continents without a pilot and has new means to avoid detection  flight trials are expected to begin in 2011  the aaai has studied this topic in depth and its president has commissioned a study to look at this issue  some have suggested a need to build  friendly ai   meaning that the advances which are already occurring with ai should also include an effort to make ai intrinsically friendly and humane  several such measures reportedly already exist  with robot heavy countries such as japan and south korea having begun to pass regulations requiring robots to be equipped with safety systems  and possibly sets of  laws  akin to asimov s three laws of robotics  an official report was issued in 2009 by the japanese government s robot industry policy committee  chinese officials and researchers have issued a report suggesting a set of ethical rules  and a set of new legal guidelines referred to as  robot legal studies   some concern has been expressed over a possible occurrence of robots telling apparent falsehoods 

mining robots are designed to solve a number of problems currently facing the mining industry  including skills shortages  improving productivity from declining ore grades  and achieving environmental targets  due to the hazardous nature of mining  in particular underground mining  the prevalence of autonomous  semi autonomous  and tele operated robots has greatly increased in recent times  a number of vehicle manufacturers provide autonomous trains  trucks and loaders that will load material  transport it on the mine site to its destination  and unload without requiring human intervention  one of the world s largest mining corporations  rio tinto  has recently expanded its autonomous truck fleet to the world s largest  consisting of 150 autonomous komatsu trucks  operating in western australia  similarly  bhp has announced the expansion of its autonomous drill fleet to the world s largest  21 autonomous atlas copco drills  drilling  longwall and rockbreaking machines are now also available as autonomous robots  the atlas copco rig control system can autonomously execute a drilling plan on a drilling rig  moving the rig into position using gps  set up the drill rig and drill down to specified depths  similarly  the transmin rocklogic system can automatically plan a path to position a rockbreaker at a selected destination  these systems greatly enhance the safety and efficiency of mining operations 

robots in healthcare have two main functions  those which assist an individual  such as a sufferer of a disease like multiple sclerosis  and those which aid in the overall systems such as pharmacies and hospitals 

robots used in home automation have developed over time from simple basic robotic assistants  such as the handy 1  through to semi autonomous robots  such as friend which can assist the elderly and disabled with common tasks  the population is aging in many countries  especially japan  meaning that there are increasing numbers of elderly people to care for  but relatively fewer young people to care for them  humans make the best carers  but where they are unavailable  robots are gradually being introduced  friend is a semi autonomous robot designed to support disabled and elderly people in their daily life activities  like preparing and serving a meal  friend make it possible for patients who are paraplegic  have muscle diseases or serious paralysis  due to strokes etc    to perform tasks without help from other people like therapists or nursing staff 

script pro manufactures a robot designed to help pharmacies fill prescriptions that consist of oral solids or medications in pill form  the pharmacist or pharmacy technician enters the prescription information into its information system  the system  upon determining whether or not the drug is in the robot  will send the information to the robot for filling  the robot has 3 different size vials to fill determined by the size of the pill  the robot technician  user  or pharmacist determines the needed size of the vial based on the tablet when the robot is stocked  once the vial is filled it is brought up to a conveyor belt that delivers it to a holder that spins the vial and attaches the patient label  afterwards it is set on another conveyor that delivers the patient s medication vial to a slot labeled with the patient s name on an led read out  the pharmacist or technician then checks the contents of the vial to ensure it s the correct drug for the correct patient and then seals the vials and sends it out front to be picked up  the robot is a very time efficient device that the pharmacy depends on to fill prescriptions  mckesson s robot rx is another healthcare robotics product that helps pharmacies dispense thousands of medications daily with little or no errors  the robot can be ten feet wide and thirty feet long and can hold hundreds of different kinds of medications and thousands of doses  the pharmacy saves many resources like staff members that are otherwise unavailable in a resource scarce industry  it uses an electromechanical head coupled with a pneumatic system to capture each dose and deliver it to its either stocked or dispensed location  the head moves along a single axis while it rotates 180 degrees to pull the medications  during this process it uses barcode technology to verify its pulling the correct drug  it then delivers the drug to a patient specific bin on a conveyor belt  once the bin is filled with all of the drugs that a particular patient needs and that the robot stocks  the bin is then released and returned out on the conveyor belt to a technician waiting to load it into a cart for delivery to the floor 

while most robots today are installed in factories or homes  performing labour or life saving jobs  many new types of robot are being developed in laboratories around the world  much of the research in robotics focuses not on specific industrial tasks  but on investigations into new types of robot  alternative ways to think about or design robots  and new ways to manufacture them  it is expected that these new types of robot will be able to solve real world problems when they are finally realized 

one approach to designing robots is to base them on animals  bionickangaroo was designed and engineered by studying and applying the physiology and methods of locomotion of a kangaroo 

nanorobotics is the emerging technology field of creating machines or robots whose components are at or close to the microscopic scale of a nanometer  10 −9 meters   also known as  nanobots  or  nanites   they would be constructed from molecular machines  so far  researchers have mostly produced only parts of these complex systems  such as bearings  sensors  and synthetic molecular motors  but functioning robots have also been made such as the entrants to the nanobot robocup contest  researchers also hope to be able to create entire robots as small as viruses or bacteria  which could perform tasks on a tiny scale  possible applications include micro surgery  on the level of individual cells   utility fog  manufacturing  weaponry and cleaning  some people have suggested that if there were nanobots which could reproduce  the earth would turn into  grey goo   while others argue that this hypothetical outcome is nonsense 

a few researchers have investigated the possibility of creating robots which can alter their physical form to suit a particular task  like the fictional t 1000  real robots are nowhere near that sophisticated however  and mostly consist of a small number of cube shaped units  which can move relative to their neighbours  algorithms have been designed in case any such robots become a reality 

robots with silicone bodies and flexible actuators  air muscles  electroactive polymers  and ferrofluids  look and feel different from robots with rigid skeletons  and can have different behaviors 

inspired by colonies of insects such as ants and bees  researchers are modeling the behavior of swarms of thousands of tiny robots which together perform a useful task  such as finding something hidden  cleaning  or spying  each robot is quite simple  but the emergent behavior of the swarm is more complex  the whole set of robots can be considered as one single distributed system  in the same way an ant colony can be considered a superorganism  exhibiting swarm intelligence  the largest swarms so far created include the irobot swarm  the sri mobilerobots centibots project and the open source micro robotic project swarm  which are being used to research collective behaviors  swarms are also more resistant to failure  whereas one large robot may fail and ruin a mission  a swarm can continue even if several robots fail  this could make them attractive for space exploration missions  where failure is normally extremely costly 

robotics also has application in the design of virtual reality interfaces  specialized robots are in widespread use in the haptic research community  these robots  called  haptic interfaces   allow touch enabled user interaction with real and virtual environments  robotic forces allow simulating the mechanical properties of  virtual  objects  which users can experience through their sense of touch 



robotic characters  androids  artificial men women  or gynoids  artificial women   and cyborgs  also  bionic men women   or humans with significant mechanical enhancements  have become a staple of science fiction  the first reference in western literature to mechanical servants appears in homer s iliad  in book xviii  hephaestus  god of fire  creates new armor for the hero achilles  assisted by robots  according to the rieu translation   golden maidservants hastened to help their master  they looked like real women and could not only speak and use their limbs but were endowed with intelligence and trained in handwork by the immortal gods   the words  robot  or  android  are not used to describe them  but they are nevertheless mechanical devices human in appearance   the first use of the word robot was in karel čapek s play r u r   rossum s universal robots   written in 1920    writer karel čapek was born in czechoslovakia  czech republic   possibly the most prolific author of the twentieth century was isaac asimov  1920–1992  who published over five hundred books  asimov is probably best remembered for his science fiction stories and especially those about robots  where he placed robots and their interaction with society at the center of many of his works  asimov carefully considered the problem of the ideal set of instructions robots might be given in order to lower the risk to humans  and arrived at his three laws of robotics  a robot may not injure a human being or  through inaction  allow a human being to come to harm  a robot must obey orders given it by human beings  except where such orders would conflict with the first law  and a robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the first or second law  these were introduced in his 1942 short story  runaround   although foreshadowed in a few earlier stories  later  asimov added the zeroth law   a robot may not harm humanity  or  by inaction  allow humanity to come to harm   the rest of the laws are modified sequentially to acknowledge this  according to the oxford english dictionary  the first passage in asimov s short story  liar    1941  that mentions the first law is the earliest recorded use of the word robotics  asimov was not initially aware of this  he assumed the word already existed by analogy with mechanics  hydraulics  and other similar terms denoting branches of applied knowledge 

robots appear in many films  most of the robots in cinema are fictional  two of the most famous are r2 d2 and c 3po from the star wars franchise 

the concept of humanoid sex robots has elicited both public attention and concern  opponents of the concept have stated that the development of sex robots would be morally wrong  they argue that the introduction of such devices would be socially harmful  and demeaning to women and children 

fears and concerns about robots have been repeatedly expressed in a wide range of books and films  a common theme is the development of a master race of conscious and highly intelligent robots  motivated to take over or destroy the human race  frankenstein  1818   often called the first science fiction novel  has become synonymous with the theme of a robot or android advancing beyond its creator  other works with similar themes include the mechanical man  the terminator  runaway  robocop  the replicators in stargate  the cylons in battlestar galactica  the cybermen and daleks in doctor who  the matrix  enthiran and i  robot  some fictional robots are programmed to kill and destroy  others gain superhuman intelligence and abilities by upgrading their own software and hardware  examples of popular media where the robot becomes evil are 2001  a space odyssey  red planet and enthiran  the 2017 game horizon zero dawn explores themes of robotics in warfare  robot ethics  and the ai control problem  as well as the positive or negative impact such technologies could have on the environment  another common theme is the reaction  sometimes called the  uncanny valley   of unease and even revulsion at the sight of robots that mimic humans too closely  more recently  fictional representations of artificially intelligent robots in films such as a i  artificial intelligence and ex machina and the 2016 tv adaptation of westworld have engaged audience sympathy for the robots themselves 













a robot is a machine—especially one programmable by a computer— capable of carrying out a complex series of actions automatically  robots can be guided by an external control device or the control may be embedded within  robots may be constructed to take on human form but most robots are machines designed to perform a task with no regard to how they look  robots can be autonomous or semi autonomous and range from humanoids such as honda s advanced step in innovative mobility  asimo  and tosy s tosy ping pong playing robot  topio  to industrial robots  medical operating robots  patient assist robots  dog therapy robots  collectively programmed swarm robots  uav drones such as general atomics mq 1 predator  and even microscopic nano robots  by mimicking a lifelike appearance or automating movements  a robot may convey a sense of intelligence or thought of its own  autonomous things are expected to proliferate in the coming decade  with home robotics and the autonomous car as some of the main drivers  the branch of technology that deals with the design  construction  operation  and application of robots  as well as computer systems for their control  sensory feedback  and information processing is robotics  these technologies deal with automated machines that can take the place of humans in dangerous environments or manufacturing processes  or resemble humans in appearance  behavior  or cognition  many of today s robots are inspired by nature contributing to the field of bio inspired robotics  these robots have also created a newer branch of robotics  soft robotics  from the time of ancient civilization there have been many accounts of user configurable automated devices and even automata resembling animals and humans  designed primarily as entertainment  as mechanical techniques developed through the industrial age  there appeared more practical applications such as automated machines  remote control and wireless remote control  the term comes from a czech word  robota  meaning  forced labor   the word  robot  was first used to denote a fictional humanoid in a 1920 play r u r  by the czech writer  karel čapek but it was karel s brother josef čapek who was the word s true inventor  electronics evolved into the driving force of development with the advent of the first electronic autonomous robots created by william grey walter in bristol  england in 1948  as well as computer numerical control  cnc  machine tools in the late 1940s by john t  parsons and frank l  stulen  the first commercial  digital and programmable robot was built by george devol in 1954 and was named the unimate  it was sold to general motors in 1961 where it was used to lift pieces of hot metal from die casting machines at the inland fisher guide plant in the west trenton section of ewing township  new jersey  robots have replaced humans in performing repetitive and dangerous tasks which humans prefer not to do  or are unable to do because of size limitations  or which take place in extreme environments such as outer space or the bottom of the sea  there are concerns about the increasing use of robots and their role in society  robots are blamed for rising technological unemployment as they replace workers in increasing numbers of functions  the use of robots in military combat raises ethical concerns  the possibilities of robot autonomy and potential repercussions have been addressed in fiction and may be a realistic concern in the future 

the word robot can refer to both physical robots and virtual software agents  but the latter are usually referred to as bots  there is no consensus on which machines qualify as robots but there is general agreement among experts  and the public  that robots tend to possess some or all of the following abilities and functions  accept electronic programming  process data or physical perceptions electronically  operate autonomously to some degree  move around  operate physical parts of itself or physical processes  sense and manipulate their environment  and exhibit intelligent behavior  especially behavior which mimics humans or other animals  closely related to the concept of a robot is the field of synthetic biology  which studies entities whose nature is more comparable to beings than to machines 

the idea of automata originates in the mythologies of many cultures around the world  engineers and inventors from ancient civilizations  including ancient china  ancient greece  and ptolemaic egypt  attempted to build self operating machines  some resembling animals and humans  early descriptions of automata include the artificial doves of archytas  the artificial birds of mozi and lu ban  a  speaking  automaton by hero of alexandria  a washstand automaton by philo of byzantium  and a human automaton described in the lie zi 

many ancient mythologies  and most modern religions include artificial people  such as the mechanical servants built by the greek god hephaestus  vulcan to the romans   the clay golems of jewish legend and clay giants of norse legend  and galatea  the mythical statue of pygmalion that came to life  since circa 400 bc  myths of crete include talos  a man of bronze who guarded the cretan island of europa from pirates  in ancient greece  the greek engineer ctesibius  c  270 bc   applied a knowledge of pneumatics and hydraulics to produce the first organ and water clocks with moving figures   in the 4th century bc  the greek mathematician archytas of tarentum postulated a mechanical steam operated bird he called  the pigeon   hero of alexandria  10–70 ad   a greek mathematician and inventor  created numerous user configurable automated devices  and described machines powered by air pressure  steam and water  the 11th century lokapannatti tells of how the buddha s relics were protected by mechanical robots  bhuta vahana yanta   from the kingdom of roma visaya  rome   until they were disarmed by king ashoka  in ancient china  the 3rd century text of the lie zi describes an account of humanoid automata  involving a much earlier encounter between chinese emperor king mu of zhou and a mechanical engineer known as yan shi  an  artificer   yan shi proudly presented the king with a life size  human shaped figure of his mechanical  handiwork  made of leather  wood  and artificial organs  there are also accounts of flying automata in the han fei zi and other texts  which attributes the 5th century bc mohist philosopher mozi and his contemporary lu ban with the invention of artificial wooden birds  ma yuan  that could successfully fly  in 1066  the chinese inventor su song built a water clock in the form of a tower which featured mechanical figurines which chimed the hours  the beginning of automata is associated with the invention of early su song s astronomical clock tower featured mechanical figurines that chimed the hours  his mechanism had a programmable drum machine with pegs  cams  that bumped into little levers that operated percussion instruments  the drummer could be made to play different rhythms and different drum patterns by moving the pegs to different locations  samarangana sutradhara  a sanskrit treatise by bhoja  11th century   includes a chapter about the construction of mechanical contrivances  automata   including mechanical bees and birds  fountains shaped like humans and animals  and male and female dolls that refilled oil lamps  danced  played instruments  and re enacted scenes from hindu mythology  in renaissance italy  leonardo da vinci  1452–1519  sketched plans for a humanoid robot around 1495  da vinci s notebooks  rediscovered in the 1950s  contained detailed drawings of a mechanical knight now known as leonardo s robot  able to sit up  wave its arms and move its head and jaw  the design was probably based on anatomical research recorded in his vitruvian man  it is not known whether he attempted to build it in japan  complex animal and human automata were built between the 17th to 19th centuries  with many described in the 18th century karakuri zui  illustrated machinery  1796   one such automaton was the karakuri ningyō  a mechanized puppet  different variations of the karakuri existed  the butai karakuri  which were used in theatre  the zashiki karakuri  which were small and used in homes  and the dashi karakuri which were used in religious festivals  where the puppets were used to perform reenactments of traditional myths and legends  in france  between 1738 and 1739  jacques de vaucanson exhibited several life sized automatons  a flute player  a pipe player and a duck  the mechanical duck could flap its wings  crane its neck  and swallow food from the exhibitor s hand  and it gave the illusion of digesting its food by excreting matter stored in a hidden compartment 

remotely operated vehicles were demonstrated in the late 19th century in the form of several types of remotely controlled torpedoes  the early 1870s saw remotely controlled torpedoes by john ericsson  pneumatic   john louis lay  electric wire guided   and victor von scheliha  electric wire guided   the brennan torpedo  invented by louis brennan in 1877 was powered by two contra rotating propellors that were spun by rapidly pulling out wires from drums wound inside the torpedo  differential speed on the wires connected to the shore station allowed the torpedo to be guided to its target  making it  the world s first practical guided missile   in 1897 the british inventor ernest wilson was granted a patent for a torpedo remotely controlled by  hertzian   radio  waves and in 1898 nikola tesla publicly demonstrated a wireless controlled torpedo that he hoped to sell to the us navy  archibald low  known as the  father of radio guidance systems  for his pioneering work on guided rockets and planes during the first world war  in 1917  he demonstrated a remote controlled aircraft to the royal flying corps and in the same year built the first wire guided rocket 

 robot  was first applied as a term for artificial automata in a 1920 play r u r  by the czech writer  karel čapek  however  josef čapek was named by his brother karel as the true inventor of the term robot  the word  robot  itself was not new  having been in slavic language as robota  forced laborer   a term which classified those peasants obligated to compulsory service under the feudal system widespread in 19th century europe  see  robot patent   čapek s fictional story postulated the technological creation of artificial human bodies without souls  and the old theme of the feudal robota class eloquently fit the imagination of a new class of manufactured  artificial workers 

in 1928  one of the first humanoid robots  eric  was exhibited at the annual exhibition of the model engineers society in london  where it delivered a speech  invented by w  h  richards  the robot s frame consisted of an aluminium body of armour with eleven electromagnets and one motor powered by a twelve volt power source  the robot could move its hands and head and could be controlled through remote control or voice control  both eric and his  brother  george toured the world  westinghouse electric corporation built televox in 1926  it was a cardboard cutout connected to various devices which users could turn on and off  in 1939  the humanoid robot known as elektro was debuted at the 1939 new york world s fair  seven feet tall  2 1 m  and weighing 265 pounds  120 2 kg   it could walk by voice command  speak about 700 words  using a 78 rpm record player   smoke cigarettes  blow up balloons  and move its head and arms  the body consisted of a steel gear  cam and motor skeleton covered by an aluminum skin  in 1928  japan s first robot  gakutensoku  was designed and constructed by biologist makoto nishimura 

the first electronic autonomous robots with complex behaviour were created by william grey walter of the burden neurological institute at bristol  england in 1948 and 1949  he wanted to prove that rich connections between a small number of brain cells could give rise to very complex behaviors – essentially that the secret of how the brain worked lay in how it was wired up  his first robots  named elmer and elsie  were constructed between 1948 and 1949 and were often described as tortoises due to their shape and slow rate of movement  the three wheeled tortoise robots were capable of phototaxis  by which they could find their way to a recharging station when they ran low on battery power  walter stressed the importance of using purely electronics to simulate brain processes at a time when his contemporaries such as alan turing and john von neumann were all turning towards a view of mental processes in terms of digital computation  his work inspired subsequent generations of robotics researchers such as rodney brooks  hans moravec and mark tilden  modern incarnations of walter s turtles may be found in the form of beam robotics  the first digitally operated and programmable robot was invented by george devol in 1954 and was ultimately called the unimate  this ultimately laid the foundations of the modern robotics industry  devol sold the first unimate to general motors in 1960  and it was installed in 1961 in a plant in trenton  new jersey to lift hot pieces of metal from a die casting machine and stack them  devol s patent for the first digitally operated programmable robotic arm represents the foundation of the modern robotics industry  the first palletizing robot was introduced in 1963 by the fuji yusoki kogyo company  in 1973  a robot with six electromechanically driven axes was patented   by kuka robotics in germany  and the programmable universal manipulation arm was invented by victor scheinman in 1976  and the design was sold to unimation  commercial and industrial robots are now in widespread use performing jobs more cheaply or with greater accuracy and reliability than humans  they are also employed for jobs which are too dirty  dangerous or dull to be suitable for humans  robots are widely used in manufacturing  assembly and packing  transport  earth and space exploration  surgery  weaponry  laboratory research  and mass production of consumer and industrial goods 

various techniques have emerged to develop the science of robotics and robots  one method is evolutionary robotics  in which a number of differing robots are submitted to tests  those which perform best are used as a model to create a subsequent  generation  of robots  another method is developmental robotics  which tracks changes and development within a single robot in the areas of problem solving and other functions  another new type of robot is just recently introduced which acts both as a smartphone and robot and is named robohon  as robots become more advanced  eventually there may be a standard computer operating system designed mainly for robots  robot operating system is an open source set of programs being developed at stanford university  the massachusetts institute of technology and the technical university of munich  germany  among others  ros provides ways to program a robot s navigation and limbs regardless of the specific hardware involved  it also provides high level commands for items like image recognition and even opening doors  when ros boots up on a robot s computer  it would obtain data on attributes such as the length and movement of robots  limbs  it would relay this data to higher level algorithms  microsoft is also developing a  windows for robots  system with its robotics developer studio  which has been available since 2007  japan hopes to have full scale commercialization of service robots by 2025  much technological research in japan is led by japanese government agencies  particularly the trade ministry  many future applications of robotics seem obvious to people  even though they are well beyond the capabilities of robots available at the time of the prediction  as early as 1982 people were confident that someday robots would  1  clean parts by removing molding flash 2  spray paint automobiles with absolutely no human presence 3  pack things in boxes—for example  orient and nest chocolate candies in candy boxes 4  make electrical cable harness 5  load trucks with boxes—a packing problem 6  handle soft goods  such as garments and shoes 7  shear sheep 8  prosthesis 9  cook fast food and work in other service industries 10  household robot  generally such predictions are overly optimistic in timescale 

in 2008  caterpillar inc  developed a dump truck which can drive itself without any human operator  many analysts believe that self driving trucks may eventually revolutionize logistics  by 2014  caterpillar had a self driving dump truck which is expected to greatly change the process of mining  in 2015  these caterpillar trucks were actively used in mining operations in australia by the mining company rio tinto coal australia  some analysts believe that within the next few decades  most trucks will be self driving  a literate or  reading robot  named marge has intelligence that comes from software  she can read newspapers  find and correct misspelled words  learn about banks like barclays  and understand that some restaurants are better places to eat than others  baxter is a new robot introduced in 2012 which learns by guidance  a worker could teach baxter how to perform a task by moving its hands in the desired motion and having baxter memorize them  extra dials  buttons  and controls are available on baxter s arm for more precision and features  any regular worker could program baxter and it only takes a matter of minutes  unlike usual industrial robots that take extensive programs and coding in order to be used  this means baxter needs no programming in order to operate  no software engineers are needed  this also means baxter can be taught to perform multiple  more complicated tasks  sawyer was added in 2015 for smaller  more precise tasks 

the word robot was introduced to the public by the czech interwar writer karel čapek in his play   r u r   rossum s universal robots     published in 1920  the play begins in a factory that uses a chemical substitute for protoplasm to manufacture living  simplified people called robots  the play does not focus in detail on the technology behind the creation of these living creatures  but in their appearance they prefigure modern ideas of androids  creatures who can be mistaken for humans  these mass produced workers are depicted as efficient but emotionless  incapable of original thinking and indifferent to self preservation  at issue is whether the robots are being exploited and the consequences of human dependence upon commodified labor  especially after a number of specially formulated robots achieve self awareness and incite robots all around the world to rise up against the humans   karel čapek himself did not coin the word  he wrote a short letter in reference to an etymology in the oxford english dictionary in which he named his brother  the painter and writer josef čapek  as its actual originator  in an article in the czech journal lidové noviny in 1933  he explained that he had originally wanted to call the creatures laboři   workers   from latin labor   however  he did not like the word  and sought advice from his brother josef  who suggested  roboti   the word robota means literally  corvée    serf labor   and figuratively  drudgery  or  hard work  in czech and also  more general   work    labor  in many slavic languages  e g   bulgarian  russian  serbian  slovak  polish  macedonian  ukrainian  archaic czech  as well as robot in hungarian   traditionally the robota  hungarian robot  was the work period a serf  corvée  had to give for his lord  typically 6 months of the year  the origin of the word is the old church slavonic  old bulgarian  rabota  servitude    work  in contemporary bulgarian and russian   which in turn comes from the proto indo european root  orbh   robot is cognate with the german root arbeit  work   the word robotics  used to describe this field of study  was coined by the science fiction writer isaac asimov  asimov created the  three laws of robotics  which are a recurring theme in his books  these have since been used by many others to define laws used in fiction   the three laws are pure fiction  and no technology yet created has the ability to understand or follow them  and in fact most robots serve military purposes  which run quite contrary to the first law and often the third law   people think about asimov s laws  but they were set up to point out how a simple ethical system doesn t work  if you read the short stories  every single one is about a failure  and they are totally impractical   said dr  joanna bryson of the university of bath   



mobile robots have the capability to move around in their environment and are not fixed to one physical location  an example of a mobile robot that is in common use today is the automated guided vehicle or automatic guided vehicle  agv   an agv is a mobile robot that follows markers or wires in the floor  or uses vision or lasers  agvs are discussed later in this article  mobile robots are also found in industry  military and security environments  they also appear as consumer products  for entertainment or to perform certain tasks like vacuum cleaning  mobile robots are the focus of a great deal of current research and almost every major university has one or more labs that focus on mobile robot research  mobile robots are usually used in tightly controlled environments such as on assembly lines because they have difficulty responding to unexpected interference  because of this most humans rarely encounter robots  however domestic robots for cleaning and maintenance are increasingly common in and around homes in developed countries  robots can also be found in military applications 

industrial robots usually consist of a jointed arm  multi linked manipulator  and an end effector that is attached to a fixed surface  one of the most common type of end effector is a gripper assembly  the international organization for standardization gives a definition of a manipulating industrial robot in iso 8373   an automatically controlled  reprogrammable  multipurpose  manipulator programmable in three or more axes  which may be either fixed in place or mobile for use in industrial automation applications   this definition is used by the international federation of robotics  the european robotics research network  euron  and many national standards committees  <  see talk page as riofa is in disute  the robotics institute of america  ria  uses a broader definition  a robot is a  re programmable multi functional manipulator designed to move materials  parts  tools  or specialized devices through variable programmed motions for the performance of a variety of tasks   the ria subdivides robots into four classes  devices that manipulate objects with manual control  automated devices that manipulate objects with predetermined cycles  programmable and servo controlled robots with continuous point to point trajectories  and robots of this last type which also acquire information from the environment and move intelligently in response    >

most commonly industrial robots are fixed robotic arms and manipulators used primarily for production and distribution of goods  the term  service robot  is less well defined  the international federation of robotics has proposed a tentative definition   a service robot is a robot which operates semi  or fully autonomously to perform services useful to the well being of humans and equipment  excluding manufacturing operations  

robots are used as educational assistants to teachers  from the 1980s  robots such as turtles were used in schools and programmed using the logo language  there are robot kits like lego mindstorms  bioloid  ollo from robotis  or botbrain educational robots can help children to learn about mathematics  physics  programming  and electronics  robotics have also been introduced into the lives of elementary and high school students in the form of robot competitions with the company first  for inspiration and recognition of science and technology   the organization is the foundation for the first robotics competition  first lego league  junior first lego league  and first tech challenge competitions  there have also been devices shaped like robots such as the teaching computer  leachim  1974   and 2 xl  1976   a robot shaped game   teaching toy based on an 8 track tape player  both invented michael j  freeman 

modular robots are a new breed of robots that are designed to increase the utilization of robots by modularizing their architecture  the functionality and effectiveness of a modular robot is easier to increase compared to conventional robots  these robots are composed of a single type of identical  several different identical module types  or similarly shaped modules  which vary in size  their architectural structure allows hyper redundancy for modular robots  as they can be designed with more than 8 degrees of freedom  dof   creating the programming  inverse kinematics and dynamics for modular robots is more complex than with traditional robots  modular robots may be composed of l shaped modules  cubic modules  and u and h shaped modules  anat technology  an early modular robotic technology patented by robotics design inc   allows the creation of modular robots from u and h shaped modules that connect in a chain  and are used to form heterogeneous and homogenous modular robot systems  these  anat robots  can be designed with  n  dof as each module is a complete motorized robotic system that folds relatively to the modules connected before and after it in its chain  and therefore a single module allows one degree of freedom  the more modules that are connected to one another  the more degrees of freedom it will have  l shaped modules can also be designed in a chain  and must become increasingly smaller as the size of the chain increases  as payloads attached to the end of the chain place a greater strain on modules that are further from the base  anat h shaped modules do not suffer from this problem  as their design allows a modular robot to distribute pressure and impacts evenly amongst other attached modules  and therefore payload carrying capacity does not decrease as the length of the arm increases  modular robots can be manually or self reconfigured to form a different robot  that may perform different applications  because modular robots of the same architecture type are composed of modules that compose different modular robots  a snake arm robot can combine with another to form a dual or quadra arm robot  or can split into several mobile robots  and mobile robots can split into multiple smaller ones  or combine with others into a larger or different one  this allows a single modular robot the ability to be fully specialized in a single task  as well as the capacity to be specialized to perform multiple different tasks  modular robotic technology is currently being applied in hybrid transportation  industrial automation  duct cleaning and handling  many research centres and universities have also studied this technology  and have developed prototypes 

a collaborative robot or cobot is a robot that can safely and effectively interact with human workers while performing simple industrial tasks  however  end effectors and other environmental conditions may create hazards  and as such risk assessments should be done before using any industrial motion control application  the collaborative robots most widely used in industries today are manufactured by universal robots in denmark  rethink robotics—founded by rodney brooks  previously with irobot—introduced baxter in september 2012  as an industrial robot designed to safely interact with neighboring human workers  and be programmable for performing simple tasks  baxters stop if they detect a human in the way of their robotic arms and have prominent off switches  intended for sale to small businesses  they are promoted as the robotic analogue of the personal computer    190 companies in the us have bought baxters and they are being used commercially in the uk 

roughly half of all the robots in the world are in asia  32  in europe  and 16  in north america  1  in australasia and 1  in africa  40  of all the robots in the world are in japan  making japan the country with the highest number of robots 

as robots have become more advanced and sophisticated  experts and academics have increasingly explored the questions of what ethics might govern robots  behavior  and whether robots might be able to claim any kind of social  cultural  ethical or legal rights  one scientific team has said that it is possible that a robot brain will exist by 2019  others predict robot intelligence breakthroughs by 2050  recent advances have made robotic behavior more sophisticated  the social impact of intelligent robots is subject of a 2010 documentary film called plug   pray  vernor vinge has suggested that a moment may come when computers and robots are smarter than humans  he calls this  the singularity   he suggests that it may be somewhat or possibly very dangerous for humans  this is discussed by a philosophy called singularitarianism  in 2009  experts attended a conference hosted by the association for the advancement of artificial intelligence  aaai  to discuss whether computers and robots might be able to acquire any autonomy  and how much these abilities might pose a threat or hazard  they noted that some robots have acquired various forms of semi autonomy  including being able to find power sources on their own and being able to independently choose targets to attack with weapons  they also noted that some computer viruses can evade elimination and have achieved  cockroach intelligence   they noted that self awareness as depicted in science fiction is probably unlikely  but that there were other potential hazards and pitfalls  various media sources and scientific groups have noted separate trends in differing areas which might together result in greater robotic functionalities and autonomy  and which pose some inherent concerns  in 2015  the nao alderen robots were shown to have a capability for a degree of self awareness  researchers at the rensselaer polytechnic institute ai and reasoning lab in new york conducted an experiment where a robot became aware of itself  and corrected its answer to a question once it had realised this 

some experts and academics have questioned the use of robots for military combat  especially when such robots are given some degree of autonomous functions  there are also concerns about technology which might allow some armed robots to be controlled mainly by other robots  the us navy has funded a report which indicates that  as military robots become more complex  there should be greater attention to implications of their ability to make autonomous decisions  one researcher states that autonomous robots might be more humane  as they could make decisions more effectively  however  other experts question this  one robot in particular  the eatr  has generated public concerns over its fuel source  as it can continually refuel itself using organic substances  although the engine for the eatr is designed to run on biomass and vegetation specifically selected by its sensors  which it can find on battlefields or other local environments  the project has stated that chicken fat can also be used  manuel de landa has noted that  smart missiles  and autonomous bombs equipped with artificial perception can be considered robots  as they make some of their decisions autonomously  he believes this represents an important and dangerous trend in which humans are handing over important decisions to machines 

for centuries  people have predicted that machines would make workers obsolete and increase unemployment  although the causes of unemployment are usually thought to be due to social policy  a recent example of human replacement involves taiwanese technology company foxconn who  in july 2011  announced a three year plan to replace workers with more robots  at present the company uses ten thousand robots but will increase them to a million robots over a three year period  lawyers have speculated that an increased prevalence of robots in the workplace could lead to the need to improve redundancy laws  kevin j  delaney said  robots are taking human jobs  but bill gates believes that governments should tax companies’ use of them  as a way to at least temporarily slow the spread of automation and to fund other types of employment   the robot tax would also help pay a guaranteed living wage to the displaced workers 

at present  there are two main types of robots  based on their use  general purpose autonomous robots and dedicated robots  robots can be classified by their specificity of purpose  a robot might be designed to perform one particular task extremely well  or a range of tasks less well  all robots by their nature can be re programmed to behave differently  but some are limited by their physical form  for example  a factory robot arm can perform jobs such as cutting  welding  gluing  or acting as a fairground ride  while a pick and place robot can only populate printed circuit boards 

general purpose autonomous robots can perform a variety of functions independently  general purpose autonomous robots typically can navigate independently in known spaces  handle their own re charging needs  interface with electronic doors and elevators and perform other basic tasks  like computers  general purpose robots can link with networks  software and accessories that increase their usefulness  they may recognize people or objects  talk  provide companionship  monitor environmental quality  respond to alarms  pick up supplies and perform other useful tasks  general purpose robots may perform a variety of functions simultaneously or they may take on different roles at different times of day  some such robots try to mimic human beings and may even resemble people in appearance  this type of robot is called a humanoid robot  humanoid robots are still in a very limited stage  as no humanoid robot can  as of yet  actually navigate around a room that it has never been in  thus  humanoid robots are really quite limited  despite their intelligent behaviors in their well known environments 



over the last three decades  automobile factories have become dominated by robots  a typical factory contains hundreds of industrial robots working on fully automated production lines  with one robot for every ten human workers  on an automated production line  a vehicle chassis on a conveyor is welded  glued  painted and finally assembled at a sequence of robot stations 

industrial robots are also used extensively for palletizing and packaging of manufactured goods  for example for rapidly taking drink cartons from the end of a conveyor belt and placing them into boxes  or for loading and unloading machining centers 

mass produced printed circuit boards  pcbs  are almost exclusively manufactured by pick and place robots  typically with scara manipulators  which remove tiny electronic components from strips or trays  and place them on to pcbs with great accuracy  such robots can place hundreds of thousands of components per hour  far out performing a human in speed  accuracy  and reliability 

mobile robots  following markers or wires in the floor  or using vision or lasers  are used to transport goods around large facilities  such as warehouses  container ports  or hospitals 

limited to tasks that could be accurately defined and had to be performed the same way every time  very little feedback or intelligence was required  and the robots needed only the most basic  sensors   the limitations of these agvs are that their paths are not easily altered and they cannot alter their paths if obstacles block them  if one agv breaks down  it may stop the entire operation 

developed to deploy triangulation from beacons or bar code grids for scanning on the floor or ceiling  in most factories  triangulation systems tend to require moderate to high maintenance  such as daily cleaning of all beacons or bar codes  also  if a tall pallet or large vehicle blocks beacons or a bar code is marred  agvs may become lost  often such agvs are designed to be used in human free environments 

such as smartloader  speciminder  adam  tug eskorta  and mt 400 with motivity are designed for people friendly workspaces  they navigate by recognizing natural features  3d scanners or other means of sensing the environment in two or three dimensions help to eliminate cumulative errors in dead reckoning calculations of the agv s current position  some agvs can create maps of their environment using scanning lasers with simultaneous localization and mapping  slam  and use those maps to navigate in real time with other path planning and obstacle avoidance algorithms  they are able to operate in complex environments and perform non repetitive and non sequential tasks such as transporting photomasks in a semiconductor lab  specimens in hospitals and goods in warehouses  for dynamic areas  such as warehouses full of pallets  agvs require additional strategies using three dimensional sensors such as time of flight or stereovision cameras 

there are many jobs which humans would rather leave to robots  the job may be boring  such as domestic cleaning  or dangerous  such as exploring inside a volcano  other jobs are physically inaccessible  such as exploring another planet  cleaning the inside of a long pipe  or performing laparoscopic surgery 

almost every unmanned space probe ever launched was a robot  some were launched in the 1960s with very limited abilities  but their ability to fly and land  in the case of luna 9  is an indication of their status as a robot  this includes the voyager probes and the galileo probes  among others 

teleoperated robots  or telerobots  are devices remotely operated from a distance by a human operator rather than following a predetermined sequence of movements  but which has semi autonomous behaviour  they are used when a human cannot be present on site to perform a job because it is dangerous  far away  or inaccessible  the robot may be in another room or another country  or may be on a very different scale to the operator  for instance  a laparoscopic surgery robot allows the surgeon to work inside a human patient on a relatively small scale compared to open surgery  significantly shortening recovery time  they can also be used to avoid exposing workers to the hazardous and tight spaces such as in duct cleaning <      > when disabling a bomb  the operator sends a small robot to disable it  several authors have been using a device called the longpen to sign books remotely  teleoperated robot aircraft  like the predator unmanned aerial vehicle  are increasingly being used by the military  these pilotless drones can search terrain and fire on targets  hundreds of robots such as irobot s packbot and the foster miller talon are being used in iraq and afghanistan by the u s  military to defuse roadside bombs or improvised explosive devices  ieds  in an activity known as explosive ordnance disposal  eod  

robots are used to automate picking fruit on orchards at a cost lower than that of human pickers 

domestic robots are simple robots dedicated to a single task work in home use  they are used in simple but unwanted jobs  such as vacuum cleaning  floor washing  and lawn mowing  an example of a domestic robot is a roomba 

military robots include the swords robot which is currently used in ground based combat  it can use a variety of weapons and there is some discussion of giving it some degree of autonomy in battleground situations  unmanned combat air vehicles  ucavs   which are an upgraded form of uavs  can do a wide variety of missions  including combat  ucavs are being designed such as the bae systems mantis which would have the ability to fly themselves  to pick their own course and target  and to make most decisions on their own  the bae taranis is a ucav built by great britain which can fly across continents without a pilot and has new means to avoid detection  flight trials are expected to begin in 2011  the aaai has studied this topic in depth and its president has commissioned a study to look at this issue  some have suggested a need to build  friendly ai   meaning that the advances which are already occurring with ai should also include an effort to make ai intrinsically friendly and humane  several such measures reportedly already exist  with robot heavy countries such as japan and south korea having begun to pass regulations requiring robots to be equipped with safety systems  and possibly sets of  laws  akin to asimov s three laws of robotics  an official report was issued in 2009 by the japanese government s robot industry policy committee  chinese officials and researchers have issued a report suggesting a set of ethical rules  and a set of new legal guidelines referred to as  robot legal studies   some concern has been expressed over a possible occurrence of robots telling apparent falsehoods 

mining robots are designed to solve a number of problems currently facing the mining industry  including skills shortages  improving productivity from declining ore grades  and achieving environmental targets  due to the hazardous nature of mining  in particular underground mining  the prevalence of autonomous  semi autonomous  and tele operated robots has greatly increased in recent times  a number of vehicle manufacturers provide autonomous trains  trucks and loaders that will load material  transport it on the mine site to its destination  and unload without requiring human intervention  one of the world s largest mining corporations  rio tinto  has recently expanded its autonomous truck fleet to the world s largest  consisting of 150 autonomous komatsu trucks  operating in western australia  similarly  bhp has announced the expansion of its autonomous drill fleet to the world s largest  21 autonomous atlas copco drills  drilling  longwall and rockbreaking machines are now also available as autonomous robots  the atlas copco rig control system can autonomously execute a drilling plan on a drilling rig  moving the rig into position using gps  set up the drill rig and drill down to specified depths  similarly  the transmin rocklogic system can automatically plan a path to position a rockbreaker at a selected destination  these systems greatly enhance the safety and efficiency of mining operations 

robots in healthcare have two main functions  those which assist an individual  such as a sufferer of a disease like multiple sclerosis  and those which aid in the overall systems such as pharmacies and hospitals 

robots used in home automation have developed over time from simple basic robotic assistants  such as the handy 1  through to semi autonomous robots  such as friend which can assist the elderly and disabled with common tasks  the population is aging in many countries  especially japan  meaning that there are increasing numbers of elderly people to care for  but relatively fewer young people to care for them  humans make the best carers  but where they are unavailable  robots are gradually being introduced  friend is a semi autonomous robot designed to support disabled and elderly people in their daily life activities  like preparing and serving a meal  friend make it possible for patients who are paraplegic  have muscle diseases or serious paralysis  due to strokes etc    to perform tasks without help from other people like therapists or nursing staff 

script pro manufactures a robot designed to help pharmacies fill prescriptions that consist of oral solids or medications in pill form  the pharmacist or pharmacy technician enters the prescription information into its information system  the system  upon determining whether or not the drug is in the robot  will send the information to the robot for filling  the robot has 3 different size vials to fill determined by the size of the pill  the robot technician  user  or pharmacist determines the needed size of the vial based on the tablet when the robot is stocked  once the vial is filled it is brought up to a conveyor belt that delivers it to a holder that spins the vial and attaches the patient label  afterwards it is set on another conveyor that delivers the patient s medication vial to a slot labeled with the patient s name on an led read out  the pharmacist or technician then checks the contents of the vial to ensure it s the correct drug for the correct patient and then seals the vials and sends it out front to be picked up  the robot is a very time efficient device that the pharmacy depends on to fill prescriptions  mckesson s robot rx is another healthcare robotics product that helps pharmacies dispense thousands of medications daily with little or no errors  the robot can be ten feet wide and thirty feet long and can hold hundreds of different kinds of medications and thousands of doses  the pharmacy saves many resources like staff members that are otherwise unavailable in a resource scarce industry  it uses an electromechanical head coupled with a pneumatic system to capture each dose and deliver it to its either stocked or dispensed location  the head moves along a single axis while it rotates 180 degrees to pull the medications  during this process it uses barcode technology to verify its pulling the correct drug  it then delivers the drug to a patient specific bin on a conveyor belt  once the bin is filled with all of the drugs that a particular patient needs and that the robot stocks  the bin is then released and returned out on the conveyor belt to a technician waiting to load it into a cart for delivery to the floor 

while most robots today are installed in factories or homes  performing labour or life saving jobs  many new types of robot are being developed in laboratories around the world  much of the research in robotics focuses not on specific industrial tasks  but on investigations into new types of robot  alternative ways to think about or design robots  and new ways to manufacture them  it is expected that these new types of robot will be able to solve real world problems when they are finally realized 

one approach to designing robots is to base them on animals  bionickangaroo was designed and engineered by studying and applying the physiology and methods of locomotion of a kangaroo 

nanorobotics is the emerging technology field of creating machines or robots whose components are at or close to the microscopic scale of a nanometer  10 −9 meters   also known as  nanobots  or  nanites   they would be constructed from molecular machines  so far  researchers have mostly produced only parts of these complex systems  such as bearings  sensors  and synthetic molecular motors  but functioning robots have also been made such as the entrants to the nanobot robocup contest  researchers also hope to be able to create entire robots as small as viruses or bacteria  which could perform tasks on a tiny scale  possible applications include micro surgery  on the level of individual cells   utility fog  manufacturing  weaponry and cleaning  some people have suggested that if there were nanobots which could reproduce  the earth would turn into  grey goo   while others argue that this hypothetical outcome is nonsense 

a few researchers have investigated the possibility of creating robots which can alter their physical form to suit a particular task  like the fictional t 1000  real robots are nowhere near that sophisticated however  and mostly consist of a small number of cube shaped units  which can move relative to their neighbours  algorithms have been designed in case any such robots become a reality 

robots with silicone bodies and flexible actuators  air muscles  electroactive polymers  and ferrofluids  look and feel different from robots with rigid skeletons  and can have different behaviors 

inspired by colonies of insects such as ants and bees  researchers are modeling the behavior of swarms of thousands of tiny robots which together perform a useful task  such as finding something hidden  cleaning  or spying  each robot is quite simple  but the emergent behavior of the swarm is more complex  the whole set of robots can be considered as one single distributed system  in the same way an ant colony can be considered a superorganism  exhibiting swarm intelligence  the largest swarms so far created include the irobot swarm  the sri mobilerobots centibots project and the open source micro robotic project swarm  which are being used to research collective behaviors  swarms are also more resistant to failure  whereas one large robot may fail and ruin a mission  a swarm can continue even if several robots fail  this could make them attractive for space exploration missions  where failure is normally extremely costly 

robotics also has application in the design of virtual reality interfaces  specialized robots are in widespread use in the haptic research community  these robots  called  haptic interfaces   allow touch enabled user interaction with real and virtual environments  robotic forces allow simulating the mechanical properties of  virtual  objects  which users can experience through their sense of touch 



robotic characters  androids  artificial men women  or gynoids  artificial women   and cyborgs  also  bionic men women   or humans with significant mechanical enhancements  have become a staple of science fiction  the first reference in western literature to mechanical servants appears in homer s iliad  in book xviii  hephaestus  god of fire  creates new armor for the hero achilles  assisted by robots  according to the rieu translation   golden maidservants hastened to help their master  they looked like real women and could not only speak and use their limbs but were endowed with intelligence and trained in handwork by the immortal gods   the words  robot  or  android  are not used to describe them  but they are nevertheless mechanical devices human in appearance   the first use of the word robot was in karel čapek s play r u r   rossum s universal robots   written in 1920    writer karel čapek was born in czechoslovakia  czech republic   possibly the most prolific author of the twentieth century was isaac asimov  1920–1992  who published over five hundred books  asimov is probably best remembered for his science fiction stories and especially those about robots  where he placed robots and their interaction with society at the center of many of his works  asimov carefully considered the problem of the ideal set of instructions robots might be given in order to lower the risk to humans  and arrived at his three laws of robotics  a robot may not injure a human being or  through inaction  allow a human being to come to harm  a robot must obey orders given it by human beings  except where such orders would conflict with the first law  and a robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the first or second law  these were introduced in his 1942 short story  runaround   although foreshadowed in a few earlier stories  later  asimov added the zeroth law   a robot may not harm humanity  or  by inaction  allow humanity to come to harm   the rest of the laws are modified sequentially to acknowledge this  according to the oxford english dictionary  the first passage in asimov s short story  liar    1941  that mentions the first law is the earliest recorded use of the word robotics  asimov was not initially aware of this  he assumed the word already existed by analogy with mechanics  hydraulics  and other similar terms denoting branches of applied knowledge 

robots appear in many films  most of the robots in cinema are fictional  two of the most famous are r2 d2 and c 3po from the star wars franchise 

the concept of humanoid sex robots has elicited both public attention and concern  opponents of the concept have stated that the development of sex robots would be morally wrong  they argue that the introduction of such devices would be socially harmful  and demeaning to women and children 

fears and concerns about robots have been repeatedly expressed in a wide range of books and films  a common theme is the development of a master race of conscious and highly intelligent robots  motivated to take over or destroy the human race  frankenstein  1818   often called the first science fiction novel  has become synonymous with the theme of a robot or android advancing beyond its creator  other works with similar themes include the mechanical man  the terminator  runaway  robocop  the replicators in stargate  the cylons in battlestar galactica  the cybermen and daleks in doctor who  the matrix  enthiran and i  robot  some fictional robots are programmed to kill and destroy  others gain superhuman intelligence and abilities by upgrading their own software and hardware  examples of popular media where the robot becomes evil are 2001  a space odyssey  red planet and enthiran  the 2017 game horizon zero dawn explores themes of robotics in warfare  robot ethics  and the ai control problem  as well as the positive or negative impact such technologies could have on the environment  another common theme is the reaction  sometimes called the  uncanny valley   of unease and even revulsion at the sight of robots that mimic humans too closely  more recently  fictional representations of artificially intelligent robots in films such as a i  artificial intelligence and ex machina and the 2016 tv adaptation of westworld have engaged audience sympathy for the robots themselves 













a robot is a machine—especially one programmable by a computer— capable of carrying out a complex series of actions automatically  robots can be guided by an external control device or the control may be embedded within  robots may be constructed to take on human form but most robots are machines designed to perform a task with no regard to how they look  robots can be autonomous or semi autonomous and range from humanoids such as honda s advanced step in innovative mobility  asimo  and tosy s tosy ping pong playing robot  topio  to industrial robots  medical operating robots  patient assist robots  dog therapy robots  collectively programmed swarm robots  uav drones such as general atomics mq 1 predator  and even microscopic nano robots  by mimicking a lifelike appearance or automating movements  a robot may convey a sense of intelligence or thought of its own  autonomous things are expected to proliferate in the coming decade  with home robotics and the autonomous car as some of the main drivers  the branch of technology that deals with the design  construction  operation  and application of robots  as well as computer systems for their control  sensory feedback  and information processing is robotics  these technologies deal with automated machines that can take the place of humans in dangerous environments or manufacturing processes  or resemble humans in appearance  behavior  or cognition  many of today s robots are inspired by nature contributing to the field of bio inspired robotics  these robots have also created a newer branch of robotics  soft robotics  from the time of ancient civilization there have been many accounts of user configurable automated devices and even automata resembling animals and humans  designed primarily as entertainment  as mechanical techniques developed through the industrial age  there appeared more practical applications such as automated machines  remote control and wireless remote control  the term comes from a czech word  robota  meaning  forced labor   the word  robot  was first used to denote a fictional humanoid in a 1920 play r u r  by the czech writer  karel čapek but it was karel s brother josef čapek who was the word s true inventor  electronics evolved into the driving force of development with the advent of the first electronic autonomous robots created by william grey walter in bristol  england in 1948  as well as computer numerical control  cnc  machine tools in the late 1940s by john t  parsons and frank l  stulen  the first commercial  digital and programmable robot was built by george devol in 1954 and was named the unimate  it was sold to general motors in 1961 where it was used to lift pieces of hot metal from die casting machines at the inland fisher guide plant in the west trenton section of ewing township  new jersey  robots have replaced humans in performing repetitive and dangerous tasks which humans prefer not to do  or are unable to do because of size limitations  or which take place in extreme environments such as outer space or the bottom of the sea  there are concerns about the increasing use of robots and their role in society  robots are blamed for rising technological unemployment as they replace workers in increasing numbers of functions  the use of robots in military combat raises ethical concerns  the possibilities of robot autonomy and potential repercussions have been addressed in fiction and may be a realistic concern in the future 

the word robot can refer to both physical robots and virtual software agents  but the latter are usually referred to as bots  there is no consensus on which machines qualify as robots but there is general agreement among experts  and the public  that robots tend to possess some or all of the following abilities and functions  accept electronic programming  process data or physical perceptions electronically  operate autonomously to some degree  move around  operate physical parts of itself or physical processes  sense and manipulate their environment  and exhibit intelligent behavior  especially behavior which mimics humans or other animals  closely related to the concept of a robot is the field of synthetic biology  which studies entities whose nature is more comparable to beings than to machines 

the idea of automata originates in the mythologies of many cultures around the world  engineers and inventors from ancient civilizations  including ancient china  ancient greece  and ptolemaic egypt  attempted to build self operating machines  some resembling animals and humans  early descriptions of automata include the artificial doves of archytas  the artificial birds of mozi and lu ban  a  speaking  automaton by hero of alexandria  a washstand automaton by philo of byzantium  and a human automaton described in the lie zi 

many ancient mythologies  and most modern religions include artificial people  such as the mechanical servants built by the greek god hephaestus  vulcan to the romans   the clay golems of jewish legend and clay giants of norse legend  and galatea  the mythical statue of pygmalion that came to life  since circa 400 bc  myths of crete include talos  a man of bronze who guarded the cretan island of europa from pirates  in ancient greece  the greek engineer ctesibius  c  270 bc   applied a knowledge of pneumatics and hydraulics to produce the first organ and water clocks with moving figures   in the 4th century bc  the greek mathematician archytas of tarentum postulated a mechanical steam operated bird he called  the pigeon   hero of alexandria  10–70 ad   a greek mathematician and inventor  created numerous user configurable automated devices  and described machines powered by air pressure  steam and water  the 11th century lokapannatti tells of how the buddha s relics were protected by mechanical robots  bhuta vahana yanta   from the kingdom of roma visaya  rome   until they were disarmed by king ashoka  in ancient china  the 3rd century text of the lie zi describes an account of humanoid automata  involving a much earlier encounter between chinese emperor king mu of zhou and a mechanical engineer known as yan shi  an  artificer   yan shi proudly presented the king with a life size  human shaped figure of his mechanical  handiwork  made of leather  wood  and artificial organs  there are also accounts of flying automata in the han fei zi and other texts  which attributes the 5th century bc mohist philosopher mozi and his contemporary lu ban with the invention of artificial wooden birds  ma yuan  that could successfully fly  in 1066  the chinese inventor su song built a water clock in the form of a tower which featured mechanical figurines which chimed the hours  the beginning of automata is associated with the invention of early su song s astronomical clock tower featured mechanical figurines that chimed the hours  his mechanism had a programmable drum machine with pegs  cams  that bumped into little levers that operated percussion instruments  the drummer could be made to play different rhythms and different drum patterns by moving the pegs to different locations  samarangana sutradhara  a sanskrit treatise by bhoja  11th century   includes a chapter about the construction of mechanical contrivances  automata   including mechanical bees and birds  fountains shaped like humans and animals  and male and female dolls that refilled oil lamps  danced  played instruments  and re enacted scenes from hindu mythology  in renaissance italy  leonardo da vinci  1452–1519  sketched plans for a humanoid robot around 1495  da vinci s notebooks  rediscovered in the 1950s  contained detailed drawings of a mechanical knight now known as leonardo s robot  able to sit up  wave its arms and move its head and jaw  the design was probably based on anatomical research recorded in his vitruvian man  it is not known whether he attempted to build it in japan  complex animal and human automata were built between the 17th to 19th centuries  with many described in the 18th century karakuri zui  illustrated machinery  1796   one such automaton was the karakuri ningyō  a mechanized puppet  different variations of the karakuri existed  the butai karakuri  which were used in theatre  the zashiki karakuri  which were small and used in homes  and the dashi karakuri which were used in religious festivals  where the puppets were used to perform reenactments of traditional myths and legends  in france  between 1738 and 1739  jacques de vaucanson exhibited several life sized automatons  a flute player  a pipe player and a duck  the mechanical duck could flap its wings  crane its neck  and swallow food from the exhibitor s hand  and it gave the illusion of digesting its food by excreting matter stored in a hidden compartment 

remotely operated vehicles were demonstrated in the late 19th century in the form of several types of remotely controlled torpedoes  the early 1870s saw remotely controlled torpedoes by john ericsson  pneumatic   john louis lay  electric wire guided   and victor von scheliha  electric wire guided   the brennan torpedo  invented by louis brennan in 1877 was powered by two contra rotating propellors that were spun by rapidly pulling out wires from drums wound inside the torpedo  differential speed on the wires connected to the shore station allowed the torpedo to be guided to its target  making it  the world s first practical guided missile   in 1897 the british inventor ernest wilson was granted a patent for a torpedo remotely controlled by  hertzian   radio  waves and in 1898 nikola tesla publicly demonstrated a wireless controlled torpedo that he hoped to sell to the us navy  archibald low  known as the  father of radio guidance systems  for his pioneering work on guided rockets and planes during the first world war  in 1917  he demonstrated a remote controlled aircraft to the royal flying corps and in the same year built the first wire guided rocket 

 robot  was first applied as a term for artificial automata in a 1920 play r u r  by the czech writer  karel čapek  however  josef čapek was named by his brother karel as the true inventor of the term robot  the word  robot  itself was not new  having been in slavic language as robota  forced laborer   a term which classified those peasants obligated to compulsory service under the feudal system widespread in 19th century europe  see  robot patent   čapek s fictional story postulated the technological creation of artificial human bodies without souls  and the old theme of the feudal robota class eloquently fit the imagination of a new class of manufactured  artificial workers 

in 1928  one of the first humanoid robots  eric  was exhibited at the annual exhibition of the model engineers society in london  where it delivered a speech  invented by w  h  richards  the robot s frame consisted of an aluminium body of armour with eleven electromagnets and one motor powered by a twelve volt power source  the robot could move its hands and head and could be controlled through remote control or voice control  both eric and his  brother  george toured the world  westinghouse electric corporation built televox in 1926  it was a cardboard cutout connected to various devices which users could turn on and off  in 1939  the humanoid robot known as elektro was debuted at the 1939 new york world s fair  seven feet tall  2 1 m  and weighing 265 pounds  120 2 kg   it could walk by voice command  speak about 700 words  using a 78 rpm record player   smoke cigarettes  blow up balloons  and move its head and arms  the body consisted of a steel gear  cam and motor skeleton covered by an aluminum skin  in 1928  japan s first robot  gakutensoku  was designed and constructed by biologist makoto nishimura 

the first electronic autonomous robots with complex behaviour were created by william grey walter of the burden neurological institute at bristol  england in 1948 and 1949  he wanted to prove that rich connections between a small number of brain cells could give rise to very complex behaviors – essentially that the secret of how the brain worked lay in how it was wired up  his first robots  named elmer and elsie  were constructed between 1948 and 1949 and were often described as tortoises due to their shape and slow rate of movement  the three wheeled tortoise robots were capable of phototaxis  by which they could find their way to a recharging station when they ran low on battery power  walter stressed the importance of using purely electronics to simulate brain processes at a time when his contemporaries such as alan turing and john von neumann were all turning towards a view of mental processes in terms of digital computation  his work inspired subsequent generations of robotics researchers such as rodney brooks  hans moravec and mark tilden  modern incarnations of walter s turtles may be found in the form of beam robotics  the first digitally operated and programmable robot was invented by george devol in 1954 and was ultimately called the unimate  this ultimately laid the foundations of the modern robotics industry  devol sold the first unimate to general motors in 1960  and it was installed in 1961 in a plant in trenton  new jersey to lift hot pieces of metal from a die casting machine and stack them  devol s patent for the first digitally operated programmable robotic arm represents the foundation of the modern robotics industry  the first palletizing robot was introduced in 1963 by the fuji yusoki kogyo company  in 1973  a robot with six electromechanically driven axes was patented   by kuka robotics in germany  and the programmable universal manipulation arm was invented by victor scheinman in 1976  and the design was sold to unimation  commercial and industrial robots are now in widespread use performing jobs more cheaply or with greater accuracy and reliability than humans  they are also employed for jobs which are too dirty  dangerous or dull to be suitable for humans  robots are widely used in manufacturing  assembly and packing  transport  earth and space exploration  surgery  weaponry  laboratory research  and mass production of consumer and industrial goods 

various techniques have emerged to develop the science of robotics and robots  one method is evolutionary robotics  in which a number of differing robots are submitted to tests  those which perform best are used as a model to create a subsequent  generation  of robots  another method is developmental robotics  which tracks changes and development within a single robot in the areas of problem solving and other functions  another new type of robot is just recently introduced which acts both as a smartphone and robot and is named robohon  as robots become more advanced  eventually there may be a standard computer operating system designed mainly for robots  robot operating system is an open source set of programs being developed at stanford university  the massachusetts institute of technology and the technical university of munich  germany  among others  ros provides ways to program a robot s navigation and limbs regardless of the specific hardware involved  it also provides high level commands for items like image recognition and even opening doors  when ros boots up on a robot s computer  it would obtain data on attributes such as the length and movement of robots  limbs  it would relay this data to higher level algorithms  microsoft is also developing a  windows for robots  system with its robotics developer studio  which has been available since 2007  japan hopes to have full scale commercialization of service robots by 2025  much technological research in japan is led by japanese government agencies  particularly the trade ministry  many future applications of robotics seem obvious to people  even though they are well beyond the capabilities of robots available at the time of the prediction  as early as 1982 people were confident that someday robots would  1  clean parts by removing molding flash 2  spray paint automobiles with absolutely no human presence 3  pack things in boxes—for example  orient and nest chocolate candies in candy boxes 4  make electrical cable harness 5  load trucks with boxes—a packing problem 6  handle soft goods  such as garments and shoes 7  shear sheep 8  prosthesis 9  cook fast food and work in other service industries 10  household robot  generally such predictions are overly optimistic in timescale 

in 2008  caterpillar inc  developed a dump truck which can drive itself without any human operator  many analysts believe that self driving trucks may eventually revolutionize logistics  by 2014  caterpillar had a self driving dump truck which is expected to greatly change the process of mining  in 2015  these caterpillar trucks were actively used in mining operations in australia by the mining company rio tinto coal australia  some analysts believe that within the next few decades  most trucks will be self driving  a literate or  reading robot  named marge has intelligence that comes from software  she can read newspapers  find and correct misspelled words  learn about banks like barclays  and understand that some restaurants are better places to eat than others  baxter is a new robot introduced in 2012 which learns by guidance  a worker could teach baxter how to perform a task by moving its hands in the desired motion and having baxter memorize them  extra dials  buttons  and controls are available on baxter s arm for more precision and features  any regular worker could program baxter and it only takes a matter of minutes  unlike usual industrial robots that take extensive programs and coding in order to be used  this means baxter needs no programming in order to operate  no software engineers are needed  this also means baxter can be taught to perform multiple  more complicated tasks  sawyer was added in 2015 for smaller  more precise tasks 

the word robot was introduced to the public by the czech interwar writer karel čapek in his play   r u r   rossum s universal robots     published in 1920  the play begins in a factory that uses a chemical substitute for protoplasm to manufacture living  simplified people called robots  the play does not focus in detail on the technology behind the creation of these living creatures  but in their appearance they prefigure modern ideas of androids  creatures who can be mistaken for humans  these mass produced workers are depicted as efficient but emotionless  incapable of original thinking and indifferent to self preservation  at issue is whether the robots are being exploited and the consequences of human dependence upon commodified labor  especially after a number of specially formulated robots achieve self awareness and incite robots all around the world to rise up against the humans   karel čapek himself did not coin the word  he wrote a short letter in reference to an etymology in the oxford english dictionary in which he named his brother  the painter and writer josef čapek  as its actual originator  in an article in the czech journal lidové noviny in 1933  he explained that he had originally wanted to call the creatures laboři   workers   from latin labor   however  he did not like the word  and sought advice from his brother josef  who suggested  roboti   the word robota means literally  corvée    serf labor   and figuratively  drudgery  or  hard work  in czech and also  more general   work    labor  in many slavic languages  e g   bulgarian  russian  serbian  slovak  polish  macedonian  ukrainian  archaic czech  as well as robot in hungarian   traditionally the robota  hungarian robot  was the work period a serf  corvée  had to give for his lord  typically 6 months of the year  the origin of the word is the old church slavonic  old bulgarian  rabota  servitude    work  in contemporary bulgarian and russian   which in turn comes from the proto indo european root  orbh   robot is cognate with the german root arbeit  work   the word robotics  used to describe this field of study  was coined by the science fiction writer isaac asimov  asimov created the  three laws of robotics  which are a recurring theme in his books  these have since been used by many others to define laws used in fiction   the three laws are pure fiction  and no technology yet created has the ability to understand or follow them  and in fact most robots serve military purposes  which run quite contrary to the first law and often the third law   people think about asimov s laws  but they were set up to point out how a simple ethical system doesn t work  if you read the short stories  every single one is about a failure  and they are totally impractical   said dr  joanna bryson of the university of bath   



mobile robots have the capability to move around in their environment and are not fixed to one physical location  an example of a mobile robot that is in common use today is the automated guided vehicle or automatic guided vehicle  agv   an agv is a mobile robot that follows markers or wires in the floor  or uses vision or lasers  agvs are discussed later in this article  mobile robots are also found in industry  military and security environments  they also appear as consumer products  for entertainment or to perform certain tasks like vacuum cleaning  mobile robots are the focus of a great deal of current research and almost every major university has one or more labs that focus on mobile robot research  mobile robots are usually used in tightly controlled environments such as on assembly lines because they have difficulty responding to unexpected interference  because of this most humans rarely encounter robots  however domestic robots for cleaning and maintenance are increasingly common in and around homes in developed countries  robots can also be found in military applications 

industrial robots usually consist of a jointed arm  multi linked manipulator  and an end effector that is attached to a fixed surface  one of the most common type of end effector is a gripper assembly  the international organization for standardization gives a definition of a manipulating industrial robot in iso 8373   an automatically controlled  reprogrammable  multipurpose  manipulator programmable in three or more axes  which may be either fixed in place or mobile for use in industrial automation applications   this definition is used by the international federation of robotics  the european robotics research network  euron  and many national standards committees  <  see talk page as riofa is in disute  the robotics institute of america  ria  uses a broader definition  a robot is a  re programmable multi functional manipulator designed to move materials  parts  tools  or specialized devices through variable programmed motions for the performance of a variety of tasks   the ria subdivides robots into four classes  devices that manipulate objects with manual control  automated devices that manipulate objects with predetermined cycles  programmable and servo controlled robots with continuous point to point trajectories  and robots of this last type which also acquire information from the environment and move intelligently in response    >

most commonly industrial robots are fixed robotic arms and manipulators used primarily for production and distribution of goods  the term  service robot  is less well defined  the international federation of robotics has proposed a tentative definition   a service robot is a robot which operates semi  or fully autonomously to perform services useful to the well being of humans and equipment  excluding manufacturing operations  

robots are used as educational assistants to teachers  from the 1980s  robots such as turtles were used in schools and programmed using the logo language  there are robot kits like lego mindstorms  bioloid  ollo from robotis  or botbrain educational robots can help children to learn about mathematics  physics  programming  and electronics  robotics have also been introduced into the lives of elementary and high school students in the form of robot competitions with the company first  for inspiration and recognition of science and technology   the organization is the foundation for the first robotics competition  first lego league  junior first lego league  and first tech challenge competitions  there have also been devices shaped like robots such as the teaching computer  leachim  1974   and 2 xl  1976   a robot shaped game   teaching toy based on an 8 track tape player  both invented michael j  freeman 

modular robots are a new breed of robots that are designed to increase the utilization of robots by modularizing their architecture  the functionality and effectiveness of a modular robot is easier to increase compared to conventional robots  these robots are composed of a single type of identical  several different identical module types  or similarly shaped modules  which vary in size  their architectural structure allows hyper redundancy for modular robots  as they can be designed with more than 8 degrees of freedom  dof   creating the programming  inverse kinematics and dynamics for modular robots is more complex than with traditional robots  modular robots may be composed of l shaped modules  cubic modules  and u and h shaped modules  anat technology  an early modular robotic technology patented by robotics design inc   allows the creation of modular robots from u and h shaped modules that connect in a chain  and are used to form heterogeneous and homogenous modular robot systems  these  anat robots  can be designed with  n  dof as each module is a complete motorized robotic system that folds relatively to the modules connected before and after it in its chain  and therefore a single module allows one degree of freedom  the more modules that are connected to one another  the more degrees of freedom it will have  l shaped modules can also be designed in a chain  and must become increasingly smaller as the size of the chain increases  as payloads attached to the end of the chain place a greater strain on modules that are further from the base  anat h shaped modules do not suffer from this problem  as their design allows a modular robot to distribute pressure and impacts evenly amongst other attached modules  and therefore payload carrying capacity does not decrease as the length of the arm increases  modular robots can be manually or self reconfigured to form a different robot  that may perform different applications  because modular robots of the same architecture type are composed of modules that compose different modular robots  a snake arm robot can combine with another to form a dual or quadra arm robot  or can split into several mobile robots  and mobile robots can split into multiple smaller ones  or combine with others into a larger or different one  this allows a single modular robot the ability to be fully specialized in a single task  as well as the capacity to be specialized to perform multiple different tasks  modular robotic technology is currently being applied in hybrid transportation  industrial automation  duct cleaning and handling  many research centres and universities have also studied this technology  and have developed prototypes 

a collaborative robot or cobot is a robot that can safely and effectively interact with human workers while performing simple industrial tasks  however  end effectors and other environmental conditions may create hazards  and as such risk assessments should be done before using any industrial motion control application  the collaborative robots most widely used in industries today are manufactured by universal robots in denmark  rethink robotics—founded by rodney brooks  previously with irobot—introduced baxter in september 2012  as an industrial robot designed to safely interact with neighboring human workers  and be programmable for performing simple tasks  baxters stop if they detect a human in the way of their robotic arms and have prominent off switches  intended for sale to small businesses  they are promoted as the robotic analogue of the personal computer    190 companies in the us have bought baxters and they are being used commercially in the uk 

roughly half of all the robots in the world are in asia  32  in europe  and 16  in north america  1  in australasia and 1  in africa  40  of all the robots in the world are in japan  making japan the country with the highest number of robots 

as robots have become more advanced and sophisticated  experts and academics have increasingly explored the questions of what ethics might govern robots  behavior  and whether robots might be able to claim any kind of social  cultural  ethical or legal rights  one scientific team has said that it is possible that a robot brain will exist by 2019  others predict robot intelligence breakthroughs by 2050  recent advances have made robotic behavior more sophisticated  the social impact of intelligent robots is subject of a 2010 documentary film called plug   pray  vernor vinge has suggested that a moment may come when computers and robots are smarter than humans  he calls this  the singularity   he suggests that it may be somewhat or possibly very dangerous for humans  this is discussed by a philosophy called singularitarianism  in 2009  experts attended a conference hosted by the association for the advancement of artificial intelligence  aaai  to discuss whether computers and robots might be able to acquire any autonomy  and how much these abilities might pose a threat or hazard  they noted that some robots have acquired various forms of semi autonomy  including being able to find power sources on their own and being able to independently choose targets to attack with weapons  they also noted that some computer viruses can evade elimination and have achieved  cockroach intelligence   they noted that self awareness as depicted in science fiction is probably unlikely  but that there were other potential hazards and pitfalls  various media sources and scientific groups have noted separate trends in differing areas which might together result in greater robotic functionalities and autonomy  and which pose some inherent concerns  in 2015  the nao alderen robots were shown to have a capability for a degree of self awareness  researchers at the rensselaer polytechnic institute ai and reasoning lab in new york conducted an experiment where a robot became aware of itself  and corrected its answer to a question once it had realised this 

some experts and academics have questioned the use of robots for military combat  especially when such robots are given some degree of autonomous functions  there are also concerns about technology which might allow some armed robots to be controlled mainly by other robots  the us navy has funded a report which indicates that  as military robots become more complex  there should be greater attention to implications of their ability to make autonomous decisions  one researcher states that autonomous robots might be more humane  as they could make decisions more effectively  however  other experts question this  one robot in particular  the eatr  has generated public concerns over its fuel source  as it can continually refuel itself using organic substances  although the engine for the eatr is designed to run on biomass and vegetation specifically selected by its sensors  which it can find on battlefields or other local environments  the project has stated that chicken fat can also be used  manuel de landa has noted that  smart missiles  and autonomous bombs equipped with artificial perception can be considered robots  as they make some of their decisions autonomously  he believes this represents an important and dangerous trend in which humans are handing over important decisions to machines 

for centuries  people have predicted that machines would make workers obsolete and increase unemployment  although the causes of unemployment are usually thought to be due to social policy  a recent example of human replacement involves taiwanese technology company foxconn who  in july 2011  announced a three year plan to replace workers with more robots  at present the company uses ten thousand robots but will increase them to a million robots over a three year period  lawyers have speculated that an increased prevalence of robots in the workplace could lead to the need to improve redundancy laws  kevin j  delaney said  robots are taking human jobs  but bill gates believes that governments should tax companies’ use of them  as a way to at least temporarily slow the spread of automation and to fund other types of employment   the robot tax would also help pay a guaranteed living wage to the displaced workers 

at present  there are two main types of robots  based on their use  general purpose autonomous robots and dedicated robots  robots can be classified by their specificity of purpose  a robot might be designed to perform one particular task extremely well  or a range of tasks less well  all robots by their nature can be re programmed to behave differently  but some are limited by their physical form  for example  a factory robot arm can perform jobs such as cutting  welding  gluing  or acting as a fairground ride  while a pick and place robot can only populate printed circuit boards 

general purpose autonomous robots can perform a variety of functions independently  general purpose autonomous robots typically can navigate independently in known spaces  handle their own re charging needs  interface with electronic doors and elevators and perform other basic tasks  like computers  general purpose robots can link with networks  software and accessories that increase their usefulness  they may recognize people or objects  talk  provide companionship  monitor environmental quality  respond to alarms  pick up supplies and perform other useful tasks  general purpose robots may perform a variety of functions simultaneously or they may take on different roles at different times of day  some such robots try to mimic human beings and may even resemble people in appearance  this type of robot is called a humanoid robot  humanoid robots are still in a very limited stage  as no humanoid robot can  as of yet  actually navigate around a room that it has never been in  thus  humanoid robots are really quite limited  despite their intelligent behaviors in their well known environments 



over the last three decades  automobile factories have become dominated by robots  a typical factory contains hundreds of industrial robots working on fully automated production lines  with one robot for every ten human workers  on an automated production line  a vehicle chassis on a conveyor is welded  glued  painted and finally assembled at a sequence of robot stations 

industrial robots are also used extensively for palletizing and packaging of manufactured goods  for example for rapidly taking drink cartons from the end of a conveyor belt and placing them into boxes  or for loading and unloading machining centers 

mass produced printed circuit boards  pcbs  are almost exclusively manufactured by pick and place robots  typically with scara manipulators  which remove tiny electronic components from strips or trays  and place them on to pcbs with great accuracy  such robots can place hundreds of thousands of components per hour  far out performing a human in speed  accuracy  and reliability 

mobile robots  following markers or wires in the floor  or using vision or lasers  are used to transport goods around large facilities  such as warehouses  container ports  or hospitals 

limited to tasks that could be accurately defined and had to be performed the same way every time  very little feedback or intelligence was required  and the robots needed only the most basic  sensors   the limitations of these agvs are that their paths are not easily altered and they cannot alter their paths if obstacles block them  if one agv breaks down  it may stop the entire operation 

developed to deploy triangulation from beacons or bar code grids for scanning on the floor or ceiling  in most factories  triangulation systems tend to require moderate to high maintenance  such as daily cleaning of all beacons or bar codes  also  if a tall pallet or large vehicle blocks beacons or a bar code is marred  agvs may become lost  often such agvs are designed to be used in human free environments 

such as smartloader  speciminder  adam  tug eskorta  and mt 400 with motivity are designed for people friendly workspaces  they navigate by recognizing natural features  3d scanners or other means of sensing the environment in two or three dimensions help to eliminate cumulative errors in dead reckoning calculations of the agv s current position  some agvs can create maps of their environment using scanning lasers with simultaneous localization and mapping  slam  and use those maps to navigate in real time with other path planning and obstacle avoidance algorithms  they are able to operate in complex environments and perform non repetitive and non sequential tasks such as transporting photomasks in a semiconductor lab  specimens in hospitals and goods in warehouses  for dynamic areas  such as warehouses full of pallets  agvs require additional strategies using three dimensional sensors such as time of flight or stereovision cameras 

there are many jobs which humans would rather leave to robots  the job may be boring  such as domestic cleaning  or dangerous  such as exploring inside a volcano  other jobs are physically inaccessible  such as exploring another planet  cleaning the inside of a long pipe  or performing laparoscopic surgery 

almost every unmanned space probe ever launched was a robot  some were launched in the 1960s with very limited abilities  but their ability to fly and land  in the case of luna 9  is an indication of their status as a robot  this includes the voyager probes and the galileo probes  among others 

teleoperated robots  or telerobots  are devices remotely operated from a distance by a human operator rather than following a predetermined sequence of movements  but which has semi autonomous behaviour  they are used when a human cannot be present on site to perform a job because it is dangerous  far away  or inaccessible  the robot may be in another room or another country  or may be on a very different scale to the operator  for instance  a laparoscopic surgery robot allows the surgeon to work inside a human patient on a relatively small scale compared to open surgery  significantly shortening recovery time  they can also be used to avoid exposing workers to the hazardous and tight spaces such as in duct cleaning <      > when disabling a bomb  the operator sends a small robot to disable it  several authors have been using a device called the longpen to sign books remotely  teleoperated robot aircraft  like the predator unmanned aerial vehicle  are increasingly being used by the military  these pilotless drones can search terrain and fire on targets  hundreds of robots such as irobot s packbot and the foster miller talon are being used in iraq and afghanistan by the u s  military to defuse roadside bombs or improvised explosive devices  ieds  in an activity known as explosive ordnance disposal  eod  

robots are used to automate picking fruit on orchards at a cost lower than that of human pickers 

domestic robots are simple robots dedicated to a single task work in home use  they are used in simple but unwanted jobs  such as vacuum cleaning  floor washing  and lawn mowing  an example of a domestic robot is a roomba 

military robots include the swords robot which is currently used in ground based combat  it can use a variety of weapons and there is some discussion of giving it some degree of autonomy in battleground situations  unmanned combat air vehicles  ucavs   which are an upgraded form of uavs  can do a wide variety of missions  including combat  ucavs are being designed such as the bae systems mantis which would have the ability to fly themselves  to pick their own course and target  and to make most decisions on their own  the bae taranis is a ucav built by great britain which can fly across continents without a pilot and has new means to avoid detection  flight trials are expected to begin in 2011  the aaai has studied this topic in depth and its president has commissioned a study to look at this issue  some have suggested a need to build  friendly ai   meaning that the advances which are already occurring with ai should also include an effort to make ai intrinsically friendly and humane  several such measures reportedly already exist  with robot heavy countries such as japan and south korea having begun to pass regulations requiring robots to be equipped with safety systems  and possibly sets of  laws  akin to asimov s three laws of robotics  an official report was issued in 2009 by the japanese government s robot industry policy committee  chinese officials and researchers have issued a report suggesting a set of ethical rules  and a set of new legal guidelines referred to as  robot legal studies   some concern has been expressed over a possible occurrence of robots telling apparent falsehoods 

mining robots are designed to solve a number of problems currently facing the mining industry  including skills shortages  improving productivity from declining ore grades  and achieving environmental targets  due to the hazardous nature of mining  in particular underground mining  the prevalence of autonomous  semi autonomous  and tele operated robots has greatly increased in recent times  a number of vehicle manufacturers provide autonomous trains  trucks and loaders that will load material  transport it on the mine site to its destination  and unload without requiring human intervention  one of the world s largest mining corporations  rio tinto  has recently expanded its autonomous truck fleet to the world s largest  consisting of 150 autonomous komatsu trucks  operating in western australia  similarly  bhp has announced the expansion of its autonomous drill fleet to the world s largest  21 autonomous atlas copco drills  drilling  longwall and rockbreaking machines are now also available as autonomous robots  the atlas copco rig control system can autonomously execute a drilling plan on a drilling rig  moving the rig into position using gps  set up the drill rig and drill down to specified depths  similarly  the transmin rocklogic system can automatically plan a path to position a rockbreaker at a selected destination  these systems greatly enhance the safety and efficiency of mining operations 

robots in healthcare have two main functions  those which assist an individual  such as a sufferer of a disease like multiple sclerosis  and those which aid in the overall systems such as pharmacies and hospitals 

robots used in home automation have developed over time from simple basic robotic assistants  such as the handy 1  through to semi autonomous robots  such as friend which can assist the elderly and disabled with common tasks  the population is aging in many countries  especially japan  meaning that there are increasing numbers of elderly people to care for  but relatively fewer young people to care for them  humans make the best carers  but where they are unavailable  robots are gradually being introduced  friend is a semi autonomous robot designed to support disabled and elderly people in their daily life activities  like preparing and serving a meal  friend make it possible for patients who are paraplegic  have muscle diseases or serious paralysis  due to strokes etc    to perform tasks without help from other people like therapists or nursing staff 

script pro manufactures a robot designed to help pharmacies fill prescriptions that consist of oral solids or medications in pill form  the pharmacist or pharmacy technician enters the prescription information into its information system  the system  upon determining whether or not the drug is in the robot  will send the information to the robot for filling  the robot has 3 different size vials to fill determined by the size of the pill  the robot technician  user  or pharmacist determines the needed size of the vial based on the tablet when the robot is stocked  once the vial is filled it is brought up to a conveyor belt that delivers it to a holder that spins the vial and attaches the patient label  afterwards it is set on another conveyor that delivers the patient s medication vial to a slot labeled with the patient s name on an led read out  the pharmacist or technician then checks the contents of the vial to ensure it s the correct drug for the correct patient and then seals the vials and sends it out front to be picked up  the robot is a very time efficient device that the pharmacy depends on to fill prescriptions  mckesson s robot rx is another healthcare robotics product that helps pharmacies dispense thousands of medications daily with little or no errors  the robot can be ten feet wide and thirty feet long and can hold hundreds of different kinds of medications and thousands of doses  the pharmacy saves many resources like staff members that are otherwise unavailable in a resource scarce industry  it uses an electromechanical head coupled with a pneumatic system to capture each dose and deliver it to its either stocked or dispensed location  the head moves along a single axis while it rotates 180 degrees to pull the medications  during this process it uses barcode technology to verify its pulling the correct drug  it then delivers the drug to a patient specific bin on a conveyor belt  once the bin is filled with all of the drugs that a particular patient needs and that the robot stocks  the bin is then released and returned out on the conveyor belt to a technician waiting to load it into a cart for delivery to the floor 

while most robots today are installed in factories or homes  performing labour or life saving jobs  many new types of robot are being developed in laboratories around the world  much of the research in robotics focuses not on specific industrial tasks  but on investigations into new types of robot  alternative ways to think about or design robots  and new ways to manufacture them  it is expected that these new types of robot will be able to solve real world problems when they are finally realized 

one approach to designing robots is to base them on animals  bionickangaroo was designed and engineered by studying and applying the physiology and methods of locomotion of a kangaroo 

nanorobotics is the emerging technology field of creating machines or robots whose components are at or close to the microscopic scale of a nanometer  10 −9 meters   also known as  nanobots  or  nanites   they would be constructed from molecular machines  so far  researchers have mostly produced only parts of these complex systems  such as bearings  sensors  and synthetic molecular motors  but functioning robots have also been made such as the entrants to the nanobot robocup contest  researchers also hope to be able to create entire robots as small as viruses or bacteria  which could perform tasks on a tiny scale  possible applications include micro surgery  on the level of individual cells   utility fog  manufacturing  weaponry and cleaning  some people have suggested that if there were nanobots which could reproduce  the earth would turn into  grey goo   while others argue that this hypothetical outcome is nonsense 

a few researchers have investigated the possibility of creating robots which can alter their physical form to suit a particular task  like the fictional t 1000  real robots are nowhere near that sophisticated however  and mostly consist of a small number of cube shaped units  which can move relative to their neighbours  algorithms have been designed in case any such robots become a reality 

robots with silicone bodies and flexible actuators  air muscles  electroactive polymers  and ferrofluids  look and feel different from robots with rigid skeletons  and can have different behaviors 

inspired by colonies of insects such as ants and bees  researchers are modeling the behavior of swarms of thousands of tiny robots which together perform a useful task  such as finding something hidden  cleaning  or spying  each robot is quite simple  but the emergent behavior of the swarm is more complex  the whole set of robots can be considered as one single distributed system  in the same way an ant colony can be considered a superorganism  exhibiting swarm intelligence  the largest swarms so far created include the irobot swarm  the sri mobilerobots centibots project and the open source micro robotic project swarm  which are being used to research collective behaviors  swarms are also more resistant to failure  whereas one large robot may fail and ruin a mission  a swarm can continue even if several robots fail  this could make them attractive for space exploration missions  where failure is normally extremely costly 

robotics also has application in the design of virtual reality interfaces  specialized robots are in widespread use in the haptic research community  these robots  called  haptic interfaces   allow touch enabled user interaction with real and virtual environments  robotic forces allow simulating the mechanical properties of  virtual  objects  which users can experience through their sense of touch 



robotic characters  androids  artificial men women  or gynoids  artificial women   and cyborgs  also  bionic men women   or humans with significant mechanical enhancements  have become a staple of science fiction  the first reference in western literature to mechanical servants appears in homer s iliad  in book xviii  hephaestus  god of fire  creates new armor for the hero achilles  assisted by robots  according to the rieu translation   golden maidservants hastened to help their master  they looked like real women and could not only speak and use their limbs but were endowed with intelligence and trained in handwork by the immortal gods   the words  robot  or  android  are not used to describe them  but they are nevertheless mechanical devices human in appearance   the first use of the word robot was in karel čapek s play r u r   rossum s universal robots   written in 1920    writer karel čapek was born in czechoslovakia  czech republic   possibly the most prolific author of the twentieth century was isaac asimov  1920–1992  who published over five hundred books  asimov is probably best remembered for his science fiction stories and especially those about robots  where he placed robots and their interaction with society at the center of many of his works  asimov carefully considered the problem of the ideal set of instructions robots might be given in order to lower the risk to humans  and arrived at his three laws of robotics  a robot may not injure a human being or  through inaction  allow a human being to come to harm  a robot must obey orders given it by human beings  except where such orders would conflict with the first law  and a robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the first or second law  these were introduced in his 1942 short story  runaround   although foreshadowed in a few earlier stories  later  asimov added the zeroth law   a robot may not harm humanity  or  by inaction  allow humanity to come to harm   the rest of the laws are modified sequentially to acknowledge this  according to the oxford english dictionary  the first passage in asimov s short story  liar    1941  that mentions the first law is the earliest recorded use of the word robotics  asimov was not initially aware of this  he assumed the word already existed by analogy with mechanics  hydraulics  and other similar terms denoting branches of applied knowledge 

robots appear in many films  most of the robots in cinema are fictional  two of the most famous are r2 d2 and c 3po from the star wars franchise 

the concept of humanoid sex robots has elicited both public attention and concern  opponents of the concept have stated that the development of sex robots would be morally wrong  they argue that the introduction of such devices would be socially harmful  and demeaning to women and children 

fears and concerns about robots have been repeatedly expressed in a wide range of books and films  a common theme is the development of a master race of conscious and highly intelligent robots  motivated to take over or destroy the human race  frankenstein  1818   often called the first science fiction novel  has become synonymous with the theme of a robot or android advancing beyond its creator  other works with similar themes include the mechanical man  the terminator  runaway  robocop  the replicators in stargate  the cylons in battlestar galactica  the cybermen and daleks in doctor who  the matrix  enthiran and i  robot  some fictional robots are programmed to kill and destroy  others gain superhuman intelligence and abilities by upgrading their own software and hardware  examples of popular media where the robot becomes evil are 2001  a space odyssey  red planet and enthiran  the 2017 game horizon zero dawn explores themes of robotics in warfare  robot ethics  and the ai control problem  as well as the positive or negative impact such technologies could have on the environment  another common theme is the reaction  sometimes called the  uncanny valley   of unease and even revulsion at the sight of robots that mimic humans too closely  more recently  fictional representations of artificially intelligent robots in films such as a i  artificial intelligence and ex machina and the 2016 tv adaptation of westworld have engaged audience sympathy for the robots themselves 













a robot is a machine—especially one programmable by a computer— capable of carrying out a complex series of actions automatically  robots can be guided by an external control device or the control may be embedded within  robots may be constructed to take on human form but most robots are machines designed to perform a task with no regard to how they look  robots can be autonomous or semi autonomous and range from humanoids such as honda s advanced step in innovative mobility  asimo  and tosy s tosy ping pong playing robot  topio  to industrial robots  medical operating robots  patient assist robots  dog therapy robots  collectively programmed swarm robots  uav drones such as general atomics mq 1 predator  and even microscopic nano robots  by mimicking a lifelike appearance or automating movements  a robot may convey a sense of intelligence or thought of its own  autonomous things are expected to proliferate in the coming decade  with home robotics and the autonomous car as some of the main drivers  the branch of technology that deals with the design  construction  operation  and application of robots  as well as computer systems for their control  sensory feedback  and information processing is robotics  these technologies deal with automated machines that can take the place of humans in dangerous environments or manufacturing processes  or resemble humans in appearance  behavior  or cognition  many of today s robots are inspired by nature contributing to the field of bio inspired robotics  these robots have also created a newer branch of robotics  soft robotics  from the time of ancient civilization there have been many accounts of user configurable automated devices and even automata resembling animals and humans  designed primarily as entertainment  as mechanical techniques developed through the industrial age  there appeared more practical applications such as automated machines  remote control and wireless remote control  the term comes from a czech word  robota  meaning  forced labor   the word  robot  was first used to denote a fictional humanoid in a 1920 play r u r  by the czech writer  karel čapek but it was karel s brother josef čapek who was the word s true inventor  electronics evolved into the driving force of development with the advent of the first electronic autonomous robots created by william grey walter in bristol  england in 1948  as well as computer numerical control  cnc  machine tools in the late 1940s by john t  parsons and frank l  stulen  the first commercial  digital and programmable robot was built by george devol in 1954 and was named the unimate  it was sold to general motors in 1961 where it was used to lift pieces of hot metal from die casting machines at the inland fisher guide plant in the west trenton section of ewing township  new jersey  robots have replaced humans in performing repetitive and dangerous tasks which humans prefer not to do  or are unable to do because of size limitations  or which take place in extreme environments such as outer space or the bottom of the sea  there are concerns about the increasing use of robots and their role in society  robots are blamed for rising technological unemployment as they replace workers in increasing numbers of functions  the use of robots in military combat raises ethical concerns  the possibilities of robot autonomy and potential repercussions have been addressed in fiction and may be a realistic concern in the future 

the word robot can refer to both physical robots and virtual software agents  but the latter are usually referred to as bots  there is no consensus on which machines qualify as robots but there is general agreement among experts  and the public  that robots tend to possess some or all of the following abilities and functions  accept electronic programming  process data or physical perceptions electronically  operate autonomously to some degree  move around  operate physical parts of itself or physical processes  sense and manipulate their environment  and exhibit intelligent behavior  especially behavior which mimics humans or other animals  closely related to the concept of a robot is the field of synthetic biology  which studies entities whose nature is more comparable to beings than to machines 

the idea of automata originates in the mythologies of many cultures around the world  engineers and inventors from ancient civilizations  including ancient china  ancient greece  and ptolemaic egypt  attempted to build self operating machines  some resembling animals and humans  early descriptions of automata include the artificial doves of archytas  the artificial birds of mozi and lu ban  a  speaking  automaton by hero of alexandria  a washstand automaton by philo of byzantium  and a human automaton described in the lie zi 

many ancient mythologies  and most modern religions include artificial people  such as the mechanical servants built by the greek god hephaestus  vulcan to the romans   the clay golems of jewish legend and clay giants of norse legend  and galatea  the mythical statue of pygmalion that came to life  since circa 400 bc  myths of crete include talos  a man of bronze who guarded the cretan island of europa from pirates  in ancient greece  the greek engineer ctesibius  c  270 bc   applied a knowledge of pneumatics and hydraulics to produce the first organ and water clocks with moving figures   in the 4th century bc  the greek mathematician archytas of tarentum postulated a mechanical steam operated bird he called  the pigeon   hero of alexandria  10–70 ad   a greek mathematician and inventor  created numerous user configurable automated devices  and described machines powered by air pressure  steam and water  the 11th century lokapannatti tells of how the buddha s relics were protected by mechanical robots  bhuta vahana yanta   from the kingdom of roma visaya  rome   until they were disarmed by king ashoka  in ancient china  the 3rd century text of the lie zi describes an account of humanoid automata  involving a much earlier encounter between chinese emperor king mu of zhou and a mechanical engineer known as yan shi  an  artificer   yan shi proudly presented the king with a life size  human shaped figure of his mechanical  handiwork  made of leather  wood  and artificial organs  there are also accounts of flying automata in the han fei zi and other texts  which attributes the 5th century bc mohist philosopher mozi and his contemporary lu ban with the invention of artificial wooden birds  ma yuan  that could successfully fly  in 1066  the chinese inventor su song built a water clock in the form of a tower which featured mechanical figurines which chimed the hours  the beginning of automata is associated with the invention of early su song s astronomical clock tower featured mechanical figurines that chimed the hours  his mechanism had a programmable drum machine with pegs  cams  that bumped into little levers that operated percussion instruments  the drummer could be made to play different rhythms and different drum patterns by moving the pegs to different locations  samarangana sutradhara  a sanskrit treatise by bhoja  11th century   includes a chapter about the construction of mechanical contrivances  automata   including mechanical bees and birds  fountains shaped like humans and animals  and male and female dolls that refilled oil lamps  danced  played instruments  and re enacted scenes from hindu mythology  in renaissance italy  leonardo da vinci  1452–1519  sketched plans for a humanoid robot around 1495  da vinci s notebooks  rediscovered in the 1950s  contained detailed drawings of a mechanical knight now known as leonardo s robot  able to sit up  wave its arms and move its head and jaw  the design was probably based on anatomical research recorded in his vitruvian man  it is not known whether he attempted to build it in japan  complex animal and human automata were built between the 17th to 19th centuries  with many described in the 18th century karakuri zui  illustrated machinery  1796   one such automaton was the karakuri ningyō  a mechanized puppet  different variations of the karakuri existed  the butai karakuri  which were used in theatre  the zashiki karakuri  which were small and used in homes  and the dashi karakuri which were used in religious festivals  where the puppets were used to perform reenactments of traditional myths and legends  in france  between 1738 and 1739  jacques de vaucanson exhibited several life sized automatons  a flute player  a pipe player and a duck  the mechanical duck could flap its wings  crane its neck  and swallow food from the exhibitor s hand  and it gave the illusion of digesting its food by excreting matter stored in a hidden compartment 

remotely operated vehicles were demonstrated in the late 19th century in the form of several types of remotely controlled torpedoes  the early 1870s saw remotely controlled torpedoes by john ericsson  pneumatic   john louis lay  electric wire guided   and victor von scheliha  electric wire guided   the brennan torpedo  invented by louis brennan in 1877 was powered by two contra rotating propellors that were spun by rapidly pulling out wires from drums wound inside the torpedo  differential speed on the wires connected to the shore station allowed the torpedo to be guided to its target  making it  the world s first practical guided missile   in 1897 the british inventor ernest wilson was granted a patent for a torpedo remotely controlled by  hertzian   radio  waves and in 1898 nikola tesla publicly demonstrated a wireless controlled torpedo that he hoped to sell to the us navy  archibald low  known as the  father of radio guidance systems  for his pioneering work on guided rockets and planes during the first world war  in 1917  he demonstrated a remote controlled aircraft to the royal flying corps and in the same year built the first wire guided rocket 

 robot  was first applied as a term for artificial automata in a 1920 play r u r  by the czech writer  karel čapek  however  josef čapek was named by his brother karel as the true inventor of the term robot  the word  robot  itself was not new  having been in slavic language as robota  forced laborer   a term which classified those peasants obligated to compulsory service under the feudal system widespread in 19th century europe  see  robot patent   čapek s fictional story postulated the technological creation of artificial human bodies without souls  and the old theme of the feudal robota class eloquently fit the imagination of a new class of manufactured  artificial workers 

in 1928  one of the first humanoid robots  eric  was exhibited at the annual exhibition of the model engineers society in london  where it delivered a speech  invented by w  h  richards  the robot s frame consisted of an aluminium body of armour with eleven electromagnets and one motor powered by a twelve volt power source  the robot could move its hands and head and could be controlled through remote control or voice control  both eric and his  brother  george toured the world  westinghouse electric corporation built televox in 1926  it was a cardboard cutout connected to various devices which users could turn on and off  in 1939  the humanoid robot known as elektro was debuted at the 1939 new york world s fair  seven feet tall  2 1 m  and weighing 265 pounds  120 2 kg   it could walk by voice command  speak about 700 words  using a 78 rpm record player   smoke cigarettes  blow up balloons  and move its head and arms  the body consisted of a steel gear  cam and motor skeleton covered by an aluminum skin  in 1928  japan s first robot  gakutensoku  was designed and constructed by biologist makoto nishimura 

the first electronic autonomous robots with complex behaviour were created by william grey walter of the burden neurological institute at bristol  england in 1948 and 1949  he wanted to prove that rich connections between a small number of brain cells could give rise to very complex behaviors – essentially that the secret of how the brain worked lay in how it was wired up  his first robots  named elmer and elsie  were constructed between 1948 and 1949 and were often described as tortoises due to their shape and slow rate of movement  the three wheeled tortoise robots were capable of phototaxis  by which they could find their way to a recharging station when they ran low on battery power  walter stressed the importance of using purely electronics to simulate brain processes at a time when his contemporaries such as alan turing and john von neumann were all turning towards a view of mental processes in terms of digital computation  his work inspired subsequent generations of robotics researchers such as rodney brooks  hans moravec and mark tilden  modern incarnations of walter s turtles may be found in the form of beam robotics  the first digitally operated and programmable robot was invented by george devol in 1954 and was ultimately called the unimate  this ultimately laid the foundations of the modern robotics industry  devol sold the first unimate to general motors in 1960  and it was installed in 1961 in a plant in trenton  new jersey to lift hot pieces of metal from a die casting machine and stack them  devol s patent for the first digitally operated programmable robotic arm represents the foundation of the modern robotics industry  the first palletizing robot was introduced in 1963 by the fuji yusoki kogyo company  in 1973  a robot with six electromechanically driven axes was patented   by kuka robotics in germany  and the programmable universal manipulation arm was invented by victor scheinman in 1976  and the design was sold to unimation  commercial and industrial robots are now in widespread use performing jobs more cheaply or with greater accuracy and reliability than humans  they are also employed for jobs which are too dirty  dangerous or dull to be suitable for humans  robots are widely used in manufacturing  assembly and packing  transport  earth and space exploration  surgery  weaponry  laboratory research  and mass production of consumer and industrial goods 

various techniques have emerged to develop the science of robotics and robots  one method is evolutionary robotics  in which a number of differing robots are submitted to tests  those which perform best are used as a model to create a subsequent  generation  of robots  another method is developmental robotics  which tracks changes and development within a single robot in the areas of problem solving and other functions  another new type of robot is just recently introduced which acts both as a smartphone and robot and is named robohon  as robots become more advanced  eventually there may be a standard computer operating system designed mainly for robots  robot operating system is an open source set of programs being developed at stanford university  the massachusetts institute of technology and the technical university of munich  germany  among others  ros provides ways to program a robot s navigation and limbs regardless of the specific hardware involved  it also provides high level commands for items like image recognition and even opening doors  when ros boots up on a robot s computer  it would obtain data on attributes such as the length and movement of robots  limbs  it would relay this data to higher level algorithms  microsoft is also developing a  windows for robots  system with its robotics developer studio  which has been available since 2007  japan hopes to have full scale commercialization of service robots by 2025  much technological research in japan is led by japanese government agencies  particularly the trade ministry  many future applications of robotics seem obvious to people  even though they are well beyond the capabilities of robots available at the time of the prediction  as early as 1982 people were confident that someday robots would  1  clean parts by removing molding flash 2  spray paint automobiles with absolutely no human presence 3  pack things in boxes—for example  orient and nest chocolate candies in candy boxes 4  make electrical cable harness 5  load trucks with boxes—a packing problem 6  handle soft goods  such as garments and shoes 7  shear sheep 8  prosthesis 9  cook fast food and work in other service industries 10  household robot  generally such predictions are overly optimistic in timescale 

in 2008  caterpillar inc  developed a dump truck which can drive itself without any human operator  many analysts believe that self driving trucks may eventually revolutionize logistics  by 2014  caterpillar had a self driving dump truck which is expected to greatly change the process of mining  in 2015  these caterpillar trucks were actively used in mining operations in australia by the mining company rio tinto coal australia  some analysts believe that within the next few decades  most trucks will be self driving  a literate or  reading robot  named marge has intelligence that comes from software  she can read newspapers  find and correct misspelled words  learn about banks like barclays  and understand that some restaurants are better places to eat than others  baxter is a new robot introduced in 2012 which learns by guidance  a worker could teach baxter how to perform a task by moving its hands in the desired motion and having baxter memorize them  extra dials  buttons  and controls are available on baxter s arm for more precision and features  any regular worker could program baxter and it only takes a matter of minutes  unlike usual industrial robots that take extensive programs and coding in order to be used  this means baxter needs no programming in order to operate  no software engineers are needed  this also means baxter can be taught to perform multiple  more complicated tasks  sawyer was added in 2015 for smaller  more precise tasks 

the word robot was introduced to the public by the czech interwar writer karel čapek in his play   r u r   rossum s universal robots     published in 1920  the play begins in a factory that uses a chemical substitute for protoplasm to manufacture living  simplified people called robots  the play does not focus in detail on the technology behind the creation of these living creatures  but in their appearance they prefigure modern ideas of androids  creatures who can be mistaken for humans  these mass produced workers are depicted as efficient but emotionless  incapable of original thinking and indifferent to self preservation  at issue is whether the robots are being exploited and the consequences of human dependence upon commodified labor  especially after a number of specially formulated robots achieve self awareness and incite robots all around the world to rise up against the humans   karel čapek himself did not coin the word  he wrote a short letter in reference to an etymology in the oxford english dictionary in which he named his brother  the painter and writer josef čapek  as its actual originator  in an article in the czech journal lidové noviny in 1933  he explained that he had originally wanted to call the creatures laboři   workers   from latin labor   however  he did not like the word  and sought advice from his brother josef  who suggested  roboti   the word robota means literally  corvée    serf labor   and figuratively  drudgery  or  hard work  in czech and also  more general   work    labor  in many slavic languages  e g   bulgarian  russian  serbian  slovak  polish  macedonian  ukrainian  archaic czech  as well as robot in hungarian   traditionally the robota  hungarian robot  was the work period a serf  corvée  had to give for his lord  typically 6 months of the year  the origin of the word is the old church slavonic  old bulgarian  rabota  servitude    work  in contemporary bulgarian and russian   which in turn comes from the proto indo european root  orbh   robot is cognate with the german root arbeit  work   the word robotics  used to describe this field of study  was coined by the science fiction writer isaac asimov  asimov created the  three laws of robotics  which are a recurring theme in his books  these have since been used by many others to define laws used in fiction   the three laws are pure fiction  and no technology yet created has the ability to understand or follow them  and in fact most robots serve military purposes  which run quite contrary to the first law and often the third law   people think about asimov s laws  but they were set up to point out how a simple ethical system doesn t work  if you read the short stories  every single one is about a failure  and they are totally impractical   said dr  joanna bryson of the university of bath   



mobile robots have the capability to move around in their environment and are not fixed to one physical location  an example of a mobile robot that is in common use today is the automated guided vehicle or automatic guided vehicle  agv   an agv is a mobile robot that follows markers or wires in the floor  or uses vision or lasers  agvs are discussed later in this article  mobile robots are also found in industry  military and security environments  they also appear as consumer products  for entertainment or to perform certain tasks like vacuum cleaning  mobile robots are the focus of a great deal of current research and almost every major university has one or more labs that focus on mobile robot research  mobile robots are usually used in tightly controlled environments such as on assembly lines because they have difficulty responding to unexpected interference  because of this most humans rarely encounter robots  however domestic robots for cleaning and maintenance are increasingly common in and around homes in developed countries  robots can also be found in military applications 

industrial robots usually consist of a jointed arm  multi linked manipulator  and an end effector that is attached to a fixed surface  one of the most common type of end effector is a gripper assembly  the international organization for standardization gives a definition of a manipulating industrial robot in iso 8373   an automatically controlled  reprogrammable  multipurpose  manipulator programmable in three or more axes  which may be either fixed in place or mobile for use in industrial automation applications   this definition is used by the international federation of robotics  the european robotics research network  euron  and many national standards committees  <  see talk page as riofa is in disute  the robotics institute of america  ria  uses a broader definition  a robot is a  re programmable multi functional manipulator designed to move materials  parts  tools  or specialized devices through variable programmed motions for the performance of a variety of tasks   the ria subdivides robots into four classes  devices that manipulate objects with manual control  automated devices that manipulate objects with predetermined cycles  programmable and servo controlled robots with continuous point to point trajectories  and robots of this last type which also acquire information from the environment and move intelligently in response    >

most commonly industrial robots are fixed robotic arms and manipulators used primarily for production and distribution of goods  the term  service robot  is less well defined  the international federation of robotics has proposed a tentative definition   a service robot is a robot which operates semi  or fully autonomously to perform services useful to the well being of humans and equipment  excluding manufacturing operations  

robots are used as educational assistants to teachers  from the 1980s  robots such as turtles were used in schools and programmed using the logo language  there are robot kits like lego mindstorms  bioloid  ollo from robotis  or botbrain educational robots can help children to learn about mathematics  physics  programming  and electronics  robotics have also been introduced into the lives of elementary and high school students in the form of robot competitions with the company first  for inspiration and recognition of science and technology   the organization is the foundation for the first robotics competition  first lego league  junior first lego league  and first tech challenge competitions  there have also been devices shaped like robots such as the teaching computer  leachim  1974   and 2 xl  1976   a robot shaped game   teaching toy based on an 8 track tape player  both invented michael j  freeman 

modular robots are a new breed of robots that are designed to increase the utilization of robots by modularizing their architecture  the functionality and effectiveness of a modular robot is easier to increase compared to conventional robots  these robots are composed of a single type of identical  several different identical module types  or similarly shaped modules  which vary in size  their architectural structure allows hyper redundancy for modular robots  as they can be designed with more than 8 degrees of freedom  dof   creating the programming  inverse kinematics and dynamics for modular robots is more complex than with traditional robots  modular robots may be composed of l shaped modules  cubic modules  and u and h shaped modules  anat technology  an early modular robotic technology patented by robotics design inc   allows the creation of modular robots from u and h shaped modules that connect in a chain  and are used to form heterogeneous and homogenous modular robot systems  these  anat robots  can be designed with  n  dof as each module is a complete motorized robotic system that folds relatively to the modules connected before and after it in its chain  and therefore a single module allows one degree of freedom  the more modules that are connected to one another  the more degrees of freedom it will have  l shaped modules can also be designed in a chain  and must become increasingly smaller as the size of the chain increases  as payloads attached to the end of the chain place a greater strain on modules that are further from the base  anat h shaped modules do not suffer from this problem  as their design allows a modular robot to distribute pressure and impacts evenly amongst other attached modules  and therefore payload carrying capacity does not decrease as the length of the arm increases  modular robots can be manually or self reconfigured to form a different robot  that may perform different applications  because modular robots of the same architecture type are composed of modules that compose different modular robots  a snake arm robot can combine with another to form a dual or quadra arm robot  or can split into several mobile robots  and mobile robots can split into multiple smaller ones  or combine with others into a larger or different one  this allows a single modular robot the ability to be fully specialized in a single task  as well as the capacity to be specialized to perform multiple different tasks  modular robotic technology is currently being applied in hybrid transportation  industrial automation  duct cleaning and handling  many research centres and universities have also studied this technology  and have developed prototypes 

a collaborative robot or cobot is a robot that can safely and effectively interact with human workers while performing simple industrial tasks  however  end effectors and other environmental conditions may create hazards  and as such risk assessments should be done before using any industrial motion control application  the collaborative robots most widely used in industries today are manufactured by universal robots in denmark  rethink robotics—founded by rodney brooks  previously with irobot—introduced baxter in september 2012  as an industrial robot designed to safely interact with neighboring human workers  and be programmable for performing simple tasks  baxters stop if they detect a human in the way of their robotic arms and have prominent off switches  intended for sale to small businesses  they are promoted as the robotic analogue of the personal computer    190 companies in the us have bought baxters and they are being used commercially in the uk 

roughly half of all the robots in the world are in asia  32  in europe  and 16  in north america  1  in australasia and 1  in africa  40  of all the robots in the world are in japan  making japan the country with the highest number of robots 

as robots have become more advanced and sophisticated  experts and academics have increasingly explored the questions of what ethics might govern robots  behavior  and whether robots might be able to claim any kind of social  cultural  ethical or legal rights  one scientific team has said that it is possible that a robot brain will exist by 2019  others predict robot intelligence breakthroughs by 2050  recent advances have made robotic behavior more sophisticated  the social impact of intelligent robots is subject of a 2010 documentary film called plug   pray  vernor vinge has suggested that a moment may come when computers and robots are smarter than humans  he calls this  the singularity   he suggests that it may be somewhat or possibly very dangerous for humans  this is discussed by a philosophy called singularitarianism  in 2009  experts attended a conference hosted by the association for the advancement of artificial intelligence  aaai  to discuss whether computers and robots might be able to acquire any autonomy  and how much these abilities might pose a threat or hazard  they noted that some robots have acquired various forms of semi autonomy  including being able to find power sources on their own and being able to independently choose targets to attack with weapons  they also noted that some computer viruses can evade elimination and have achieved  cockroach intelligence   they noted that self awareness as depicted in science fiction is probably unlikely  but that there were other potential hazards and pitfalls  various media sources and scientific groups have noted separate trends in differing areas which might together result in greater robotic functionalities and autonomy  and which pose some inherent concerns  in 2015  the nao alderen robots were shown to have a capability for a degree of self awareness  researchers at the rensselaer polytechnic institute ai and reasoning lab in new york conducted an experiment where a robot became aware of itself  and corrected its answer to a question once it had realised this 

some experts and academics have questioned the use of robots for military combat  especially when such robots are given some degree of autonomous functions  there are also concerns about technology which might allow some armed robots to be controlled mainly by other robots  the us navy has funded a report which indicates that  as military robots become more complex  there should be greater attention to implications of their ability to make autonomous decisions  one researcher states that autonomous robots might be more humane  as they could make decisions more effectively  however  other experts question this  one robot in particular  the eatr  has generated public concerns over its fuel source  as it can continually refuel itself using organic substances  although the engine for the eatr is designed to run on biomass and vegetation specifically selected by its sensors  which it can find on battlefields or other local environments  the project has stated that chicken fat can also be used  manuel de landa has noted that  smart missiles  and autonomous bombs equipped with artificial perception can be considered robots  as they make some of their decisions autonomously  he believes this represents an important and dangerous trend in which humans are handing over important decisions to machines 

for centuries  people have predicted that machines would make workers obsolete and increase unemployment  although the causes of unemployment are usually thought to be due to social policy  a recent example of human replacement involves taiwanese technology company foxconn who  in july 2011  announced a three year plan to replace workers with more robots  at present the company uses ten thousand robots but will increase them to a million robots over a three year period  lawyers have speculated that an increased prevalence of robots in the workplace could lead to the need to improve redundancy laws  kevin j  delaney said  robots are taking human jobs  but bill gates believes that governments should tax companies’ use of them  as a way to at least temporarily slow the spread of automation and to fund other types of employment   the robot tax would also help pay a guaranteed living wage to the displaced workers 

at present  there are two main types of robots  based on their use  general purpose autonomous robots and dedicated robots  robots can be classified by their specificity of purpose  a robot might be designed to perform one particular task extremely well  or a range of tasks less well  all robots by their nature can be re programmed to behave differently  but some are limited by their physical form  for example  a factory robot arm can perform jobs such as cutting  welding  gluing  or acting as a fairground ride  while a pick and place robot can only populate printed circuit boards 

general purpose autonomous robots can perform a variety of functions independently  general purpose autonomous robots typically can navigate independently in known spaces  handle their own re charging needs  interface with electronic doors and elevators and perform other basic tasks  like computers  general purpose robots can link with networks  software and accessories that increase their usefulness  they may recognize people or objects  talk  provide companionship  monitor environmental quality  respond to alarms  pick up supplies and perform other useful tasks  general purpose robots may perform a variety of functions simultaneously or they may take on different roles at different times of day  some such robots try to mimic human beings and may even resemble people in appearance  this type of robot is called a humanoid robot  humanoid robots are still in a very limited stage  as no humanoid robot can  as of yet  actually navigate around a room that it has never been in  thus  humanoid robots are really quite limited  despite their intelligent behaviors in their well known environments 



over the last three decades  automobile factories have become dominated by robots  a typical factory contains hundreds of industrial robots working on fully automated production lines  with one robot for every ten human workers  on an automated production line  a vehicle chassis on a conveyor is welded  glued  painted and finally assembled at a sequence of robot stations 

industrial robots are also used extensively for palletizing and packaging of manufactured goods  for example for rapidly taking drink cartons from the end of a conveyor belt and placing them into boxes  or for loading and unloading machining centers 

mass produced printed circuit boards  pcbs  are almost exclusively manufactured by pick and place robots  typically with scara manipulators  which remove tiny electronic components from strips or trays  and place them on to pcbs with great accuracy  such robots can place hundreds of thousands of components per hour  far out performing a human in speed  accuracy  and reliability 

mobile robots  following markers or wires in the floor  or using vision or lasers  are used to transport goods around large facilities  such as warehouses  container ports  or hospitals 

limited to tasks that could be accurately defined and had to be performed the same way every time  very little feedback or intelligence was required  and the robots needed only the most basic  sensors   the limitations of these agvs are that their paths are not easily altered and they cannot alter their paths if obstacles block them  if one agv breaks down  it may stop the entire operation 

developed to deploy triangulation from beacons or bar code grids for scanning on the floor or ceiling  in most factories  triangulation systems tend to require moderate to high maintenance  such as daily cleaning of all beacons or bar codes  also  if a tall pallet or large vehicle blocks beacons or a bar code is marred  agvs may become lost  often such agvs are designed to be used in human free environments 

such as smartloader  speciminder  adam  tug eskorta  and mt 400 with motivity are designed for people friendly workspaces  they navigate by recognizing natural features  3d scanners or other means of sensing the environment in two or three dimensions help to eliminate cumulative errors in dead reckoning calculations of the agv s current position  some agvs can create maps of their environment using scanning lasers with simultaneous localization and mapping  slam  and use those maps to navigate in real time with other path planning and obstacle avoidance algorithms  they are able to operate in complex environments and perform non repetitive and non sequential tasks such as transporting photomasks in a semiconductor lab  specimens in hospitals and goods in warehouses  for dynamic areas  such as warehouses full of pallets  agvs require additional strategies using three dimensional sensors such as time of flight or stereovision cameras 

there are many jobs which humans would rather leave to robots  the job may be boring  such as domestic cleaning  or dangerous  such as exploring inside a volcano  other jobs are physically inaccessible  such as exploring another planet  cleaning the inside of a long pipe  or performing laparoscopic surgery 

almost every unmanned space probe ever launched was a robot  some were launched in the 1960s with very limited abilities  but their ability to fly and land  in the case of luna 9  is an indication of their status as a robot  this includes the voyager probes and the galileo probes  among others 

teleoperated robots  or telerobots  are devices remotely operated from a distance by a human operator rather than following a predetermined sequence of movements  but which has semi autonomous behaviour  they are used when a human cannot be present on site to perform a job because it is dangerous  far away  or inaccessible  the robot may be in another room or another country  or may be on a very different scale to the operator  for instance  a laparoscopic surgery robot allows the surgeon to work inside a human patient on a relatively small scale compared to open surgery  significantly shortening recovery time  they can also be used to avoid exposing workers to the hazardous and tight spaces such as in duct cleaning <      > when disabling a bomb  the operator sends a small robot to disable it  several authors have been using a device called the longpen to sign books remotely  teleoperated robot aircraft  like the predator unmanned aerial vehicle  are increasingly being used by the military  these pilotless drones can search terrain and fire on targets  hundreds of robots such as irobot s packbot and the foster miller talon are being used in iraq and afghanistan by the u s  military to defuse roadside bombs or improvised explosive devices  ieds  in an activity known as explosive ordnance disposal  eod  

robots are used to automate picking fruit on orchards at a cost lower than that of human pickers 

domestic robots are simple robots dedicated to a single task work in home use  they are used in simple but unwanted jobs  such as vacuum cleaning  floor washing  and lawn mowing  an example of a domestic robot is a roomba 

military robots include the swords robot which is currently used in ground based combat  it can use a variety of weapons and there is some discussion of giving it some degree of autonomy in battleground situations  unmanned combat air vehicles  ucavs   which are an upgraded form of uavs  can do a wide variety of missions  including combat  ucavs are being designed such as the bae systems mantis which would have the ability to fly themselves  to pick their own course and target  and to make most decisions on their own  the bae taranis is a ucav built by great britain which can fly across continents without a pilot and has new means to avoid detection  flight trials are expected to begin in 2011  the aaai has studied this topic in depth and its president has commissioned a study to look at this issue  some have suggested a need to build  friendly ai   meaning that the advances which are already occurring with ai should also include an effort to make ai intrinsically friendly and humane  several such measures reportedly already exist  with robot heavy countries such as japan and south korea having begun to pass regulations requiring robots to be equipped with safety systems  and possibly sets of  laws  akin to asimov s three laws of robotics  an official report was issued in 2009 by the japanese government s robot industry policy committee  chinese officials and researchers have issued a report suggesting a set of ethical rules  and a set of new legal guidelines referred to as  robot legal studies   some concern has been expressed over a possible occurrence of robots telling apparent falsehoods 

mining robots are designed to solve a number of problems currently facing the mining industry  including skills shortages  improving productivity from declining ore grades  and achieving environmental targets  due to the hazardous nature of mining  in particular underground mining  the prevalence of autonomous  semi autonomous  and tele operated robots has greatly increased in recent times  a number of vehicle manufacturers provide autonomous trains  trucks and loaders that will load material  transport it on the mine site to its destination  and unload without requiring human intervention  one of the world s largest mining corporations  rio tinto  has recently expanded its autonomous truck fleet to the world s largest  consisting of 150 autonomous komatsu trucks  operating in western australia  similarly  bhp has announced the expansion of its autonomous drill fleet to the world s largest  21 autonomous atlas copco drills  drilling  longwall and rockbreaking machines are now also available as autonomous robots  the atlas copco rig control system can autonomously execute a drilling plan on a drilling rig  moving the rig into position using gps  set up the drill rig and drill down to specified depths  similarly  the transmin rocklogic system can automatically plan a path to position a rockbreaker at a selected destination  these systems greatly enhance the safety and efficiency of mining operations 

robots in healthcare have two main functions  those which assist an individual  such as a sufferer of a disease like multiple sclerosis  and those which aid in the overall systems such as pharmacies and hospitals 

robots used in home automation have developed over time from simple basic robotic assistants  such as the handy 1  through to semi autonomous robots  such as friend which can assist the elderly and disabled with common tasks  the population is aging in many countries  especially japan  meaning that there are increasing numbers of elderly people to care for  but relatively fewer young people to care for them  humans make the best carers  but where they are unavailable  robots are gradually being introduced  friend is a semi autonomous robot designed to support disabled and elderly people in their daily life activities  like preparing and serving a meal  friend make it possible for patients who are paraplegic  have muscle diseases or serious paralysis  due to strokes etc    to perform tasks without help from other people like therapists or nursing staff 

script pro manufactures a robot designed to help pharmacies fill prescriptions that consist of oral solids or medications in pill form  the pharmacist or pharmacy technician enters the prescription information into its information system  the system  upon determining whether or not the drug is in the robot  will send the information to the robot for filling  the robot has 3 different size vials to fill determined by the size of the pill  the robot technician  user  or pharmacist determines the needed size of the vial based on the tablet when the robot is stocked  once the vial is filled it is brought up to a conveyor belt that delivers it to a holder that spins the vial and attaches the patient label  afterwards it is set on another conveyor that delivers the patient s medication vial to a slot labeled with the patient s name on an led read out  the pharmacist or technician then checks the contents of the vial to ensure it s the correct drug for the correct patient and then seals the vials and sends it out front to be picked up  the robot is a very time efficient device that the pharmacy depends on to fill prescriptions  mckesson s robot rx is another healthcare robotics product that helps pharmacies dispense thousands of medications daily with little or no errors  the robot can be ten feet wide and thirty feet long and can hold hundreds of different kinds of medications and thousands of doses  the pharmacy saves many resources like staff members that are otherwise unavailable in a resource scarce industry  it uses an electromechanical head coupled with a pneumatic system to capture each dose and deliver it to its either stocked or dispensed location  the head moves along a single axis while it rotates 180 degrees to pull the medications  during this process it uses barcode technology to verify its pulling the correct drug  it then delivers the drug to a patient specific bin on a conveyor belt  once the bin is filled with all of the drugs that a particular patient needs and that the robot stocks  the bin is then released and returned out on the conveyor belt to a technician waiting to load it into a cart for delivery to the floor 

while most robots today are installed in factories or homes  performing labour or life saving jobs  many new types of robot are being developed in laboratories around the world  much of the research in robotics focuses not on specific industrial tasks  but on investigations into new types of robot  alternative ways to think about or design robots  and new ways to manufacture them  it is expected that these new types of robot will be able to solve real world problems when they are finally realized 

one approach to designing robots is to base them on animals  bionickangaroo was designed and engineered by studying and applying the physiology and methods of locomotion of a kangaroo 

nanorobotics is the emerging technology field of creating machines or robots whose components are at or close to the microscopic scale of a nanometer  10 −9 meters   also known as  nanobots  or  nanites   they would be constructed from molecular machines  so far  researchers have mostly produced only parts of these complex systems  such as bearings  sensors  and synthetic molecular motors  but functioning robots have also been made such as the entrants to the nanobot robocup contest  researchers also hope to be able to create entire robots as small as viruses or bacteria  which could perform tasks on a tiny scale  possible applications include micro surgery  on the level of individual cells   utility fog  manufacturing  weaponry and cleaning  some people have suggested that if there were nanobots which could reproduce  the earth would turn into  grey goo   while others argue that this hypothetical outcome is nonsense 

a few researchers have investigated the possibility of creating robots which can alter their physical form to suit a particular task  like the fictional t 1000  real robots are nowhere near that sophisticated however  and mostly consist of a small number of cube shaped units  which can move relative to their neighbours  algorithms have been designed in case any such robots become a reality 

robots with silicone bodies and flexible actuators  air muscles  electroactive polymers  and ferrofluids  look and feel different from robots with rigid skeletons  and can have different behaviors 

inspired by colonies of insects such as ants and bees  researchers are modeling the behavior of swarms of thousands of tiny robots which together perform a useful task  such as finding something hidden  cleaning  or spying  each robot is quite simple  but the emergent behavior of the swarm is more complex  the whole set of robots can be considered as one single distributed system  in the same way an ant colony can be considered a superorganism  exhibiting swarm intelligence  the largest swarms so far created include the irobot swarm  the sri mobilerobots centibots project and the open source micro robotic project swarm  which are being used to research collective behaviors  swarms are also more resistant to failure  whereas one large robot may fail and ruin a mission  a swarm can continue even if several robots fail  this could make them attractive for space exploration missions  where failure is normally extremely costly 

robotics also has application in the design of virtual reality interfaces  specialized robots are in widespread use in the haptic research community  these robots  called  haptic interfaces   allow touch enabled user interaction with real and virtual environments  robotic forces allow simulating the mechanical properties of  virtual  objects  which users can experience through their sense of touch 



robotic characters  androids  artificial men women  or gynoids  artificial women   and cyborgs  also  bionic men women   or humans with significant mechanical enhancements  have become a staple of science fiction  the first reference in western literature to mechanical servants appears in homer s iliad  in book xviii  hephaestus  god of fire  creates new armor for the hero achilles  assisted by robots  according to the rieu translation   golden maidservants hastened to help their master  they looked like real women and could not only speak and use their limbs but were endowed with intelligence and trained in handwork by the immortal gods   the words  robot  or  android  are not used to describe them  but they are nevertheless mechanical devices human in appearance   the first use of the word robot was in karel čapek s play r u r   rossum s universal robots   written in 1920    writer karel čapek was born in czechoslovakia  czech republic   possibly the most prolific author of the twentieth century was isaac asimov  1920–1992  who published over five hundred books  asimov is probably best remembered for his science fiction stories and especially those about robots  where he placed robots and their interaction with society at the center of many of his works  asimov carefully considered the problem of the ideal set of instructions robots might be given in order to lower the risk to humans  and arrived at his three laws of robotics  a robot may not injure a human being or  through inaction  allow a human being to come to harm  a robot must obey orders given it by human beings  except where such orders would conflict with the first law  and a robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the first or second law  these were introduced in his 1942 short story  runaround   although foreshadowed in a few earlier stories  later  asimov added the zeroth law   a robot may not harm humanity  or  by inaction  allow humanity to come to harm   the rest of the laws are modified sequentially to acknowledge this  according to the oxford english dictionary  the first passage in asimov s short story  liar    1941  that mentions the first law is the earliest recorded use of the word robotics  asimov was not initially aware of this  he assumed the word already existed by analogy with mechanics  hydraulics  and other similar terms denoting branches of applied knowledge 

robots appear in many films  most of the robots in cinema are fictional  two of the most famous are r2 d2 and c 3po from the star wars franchise 

the concept of humanoid sex robots has elicited both public attention and concern  opponents of the concept have stated that the development of sex robots would be morally wrong  they argue that the introduction of such devices would be socially harmful  and demeaning to women and children 

fears and concerns about robots have been repeatedly expressed in a wide range of books and films  a common theme is the development of a master race of conscious and highly intelligent robots  motivated to take over or destroy the human race  frankenstein  1818   often called the first science fiction novel  has become synonymous with the theme of a robot or android advancing beyond its creator  other works with similar themes include the mechanical man  the terminator  runaway  robocop  the replicators in stargate  the cylons in battlestar galactica  the cybermen and daleks in doctor who  the matrix  enthiran and i  robot  some fictional robots are programmed to kill and destroy  others gain superhuman intelligence and abilities by upgrading their own software and hardware  examples of popular media where the robot becomes evil are 2001  a space odyssey  red planet and enthiran  the 2017 game horizon zero dawn explores themes of robotics in warfare  robot ethics  and the ai control problem  as well as the positive or negative impact such technologies could have on the environment  another common theme is the reaction  sometimes called the  uncanny valley   of unease and even revulsion at the sight of robots that mimic humans too closely  more recently  fictional representations of artificially intelligent robots in films such as a i  artificial intelligence and ex machina and the 2016 tv adaptation of westworld have engaged audience sympathy for the robots themselves
