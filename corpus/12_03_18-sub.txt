crying up at me  mad as thunder  were you with her  rachael  freysa  i held her
as she died  we hid the child and made
a vow to keep our secret  that s why sapper
let you kill him  i knew that baby meant
we are more than just slaves  if a baby can come
from one of us  we are our own masters  more human than humans  freysa 
a revolution is coming  and we re building an army  i want to free our people  if you want to be free  join us  deckard  sapper  you  me  our lives mean nothing

his baby to be safe  and she is  when the time comes  i will show her

you looked back on that day  drunk on the memory
of its perfection  how shiny her lips  how instant your connection  did it never occur to you that s why you were summoned
in the first place  designed to do nothing short
of fall for her right then and there  all to make
that single perfect specimen  that is  if you were designed  love or mathematical precision  yes  no   sighs  i know what s real   sighing heavily  it was very clever
to keep yourself empty of information  and all it cost you
was everything  but you can still help me  you had help in the hiding  where did they go  i know you know something  help me  and very  very good things
can come to you  you don t have children  do you  oh  i have millions  you think i have
nothing to offer but pain  only i know you love pain  pain reminds you
